LID - a041471
AB  - Recent advancements in specialized large-scale architectures for training images 
      and language have profoundly impacted the field of computer vision and natural 
      language processing (NLP). Language models, such as the recent ChatGPT and GPT-4, 
      have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in processing, translating, and 
      generating human language. These breakthroughs have also been reflected in 
      protein research, leading to the rapid development of numerous new methods in a 
      short time, with unprecedented performance. Several of these models have been 
      developed with the goal of generating sequences in novel regions of the protein 
      space. In this work, we provide an overview of the use of protein generative 
      models, reviewing (1) language models for the design of novel artificial 
      proteins, (2) works that use non-transformer architectures, and (3) applications 
      in directed evolution approaches.

TI  - GeneGPT: Augmenting Large Language Models with Domain Tools for Improved Access 
      to Biomedical Information.
LID - arXiv:2304.09667v3
AB  - While large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to various 
      tasks, they still face challenges with hallucinations. Augmenting LLMs with 
      domain-specific tools such as database utilities can facilitate easier and more 
      precise access to specialized knowledge. In this paper, we present GeneGPT, a 
      novel method for teaching LLMs to use the Web APIs of the National Center for 
      Biotechnology Information (NCBI) for answering genomics questions. Specifically, 
      we prompt Codex to solve the GeneTuring tests with NCBI Web APIs by in-context 
      learning and an augmented decoding algorithm that can detect and execute API 
      calls. Experimental results show that GeneGPT achieves state-of-the-art 
      performance on eight tasks in the GeneTuring benchmark with an average score of 
      0.83, largely surpassing retrieval-augmented LLMs such as the new Bing (0.44), 
      biomedical LLMs such as BioMedLM (0.08) and BioGPT (0.04), as well as GPT-3 
      (0.16) and ChatGPT (0.12). Our further analyses suggest that: (1) API 
      demonstrations have good cross-task generalizability and are more useful than 
      documentations for in-context learning; (2) GeneGPT can generalize to longer 
      chains of API calls and answer multi-hop questions in GeneHop, a novel dataset 
      introduced in this work; (3) Different types of errors are enriched in different 
      tasks, providing valuable insights for future improvements.

TI  - Large Language Models as a Rapid and Objective Tool for Pathology Report Data 
      Extraction.
LID - 10.5146/tjpath.2024.13256 [doi]
AB  - Medical institutions continuously create a substantial amount of data that is 
      used for scientific research. One of the departments with a great amount of 
      archived data is the pathology department. Pathology archives hold the potential 
      to create a case series of valuable rare entities or large cohorts of common 
      entities. The major problem in creation of these databases is data extraction 
      which is still commonly done manually and is highly laborious and error prone. 
      For these reasons, we offer using large language models to overcome these 
      challenges. Ten pathology reports of selected resection specimens were retrieved 
      from electronic archives of KoÃ§ University Hospital for the initial set. These 
      reports were de-identified and uploaded to ChatGPT and Google Bard. Both 
      algorithms were asked to turn the reports in a synoptic report format that is 
      easy to export to a data editor such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. Both 
      programs created tables with Google Bard facilitating the creation of a 
      spreadsheet from the data automatically. In conclusion, we propose the use of 
      AI-assisted data extraction for academic research purposes, as it may enhance 
      efficiency and precision compared to manual data entry.

TI  - A Survey of Clinicians' Views of the Utility of Large Language Models.
LID - 10.1055/a-2281-7092 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are powerful algorithms that 
      have been shown to produce human-like text from input data. A number of potential 
      clinical applications of this technology have been proposed and evaluated by 
      biomedical informatics experts. However, few have surveyed healthcare providers 
      for their opinions about whether the technology is fit for use. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: We distributed a validated mixed-methods survey to gauge practicing 
      clinicians' comfort with LLMs for a breadth of tasks in clinical practice, 
      research and education, which were selected from the literature. RESULTS: A total 
      of 30 clinicians fully completed the survey. Of the 23 tasks, 16 were rated 
      positively by more than 50% of the respondents. Based on our qualitative 
      analysis, healthcare providers considered LLMs to have excellent synthesis skills 
      and efficiency. However, our respondents had concerns that LLMs could generate 
      false information and propagate training data bias. DISCUSSION: Our survey 
      respondents were most comfortable with scenarios that allow LLMs to function in 
      an assistive role, like a physician extender or trainee. CONCLUSION: In a 
      uniquely rigorous and comprehensive mixed-methods survey of clinicians about LLM 
      use, healthcare providers were encouraging of having LLMs in healthcare for many 
      tasks, and especially in assistive roles. There is a need for continued 
      human-centered development of both LLMs and artificial intelligence (AI) in 
      general.

LID - 10.1001/jamasurg.2023.6496 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: This review aims to assess the benefits and risks of implementing 
      large language model (LLM) solutions in an academic surgical setting. 
      OBSERVATIONS: The integration of LLMs and artificial intelligence (AI) into 
      surgical practice has generated international attention with the emergence of 
      OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard. From an administrative standpoint, LLMs have 
      the potential to revolutionize academic practices by reducing administrative 
      burdens and improving efficiency. LLMs have the potential to facilitate surgical 
      research by increasing writing efficiency, building predictive models, and aiding 
      in large dataset analysis. From a clinical standpoint, LLMs can enhance 
      efficiency by triaging patient concerns and generating automated responses. 
      However, challenges exist, such as the need for improved LLM generalization 
      performance, validating content, and addressing ethical concerns. In addition, 
      patient privacy, potential bias in training, and legal responsibility are 
      important considerations that require attention. Research and precautionary 
      measures are necessary to ensure safe and unbiased use of LLMs in surgery. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although limitations exist, LLMs hold promise for 
      enhancing surgical efficiency while still prioritizing patient care. The authors 
      recommend that the academic surgical community further investigate the potential 
      applications of LLMs while being cautious about potential harms.

TI  - Large Language Models and Healthcare Alliance: Potential and Challenges of Two 
      Representative Use Cases.
LID - 10.1007/s10439-024-03454-8 [doi]
AB  - Large language models (LLMS)&nbsp;emerge as the most promising Natural Language 
      Processing approach for clinical practice acceleration (i.e., diagnosis, 
      prevention and treatment procedures). Similarly, intelligent conversational 
      systems that leverage LLMS have disruptively become the future of therapy in the 
      era of ChatGPT. Accordingly, this research addresses the application of LLMS in 
      healthcare, paying particular attention to two relevant use cases: cognitive 
      decline and depression, more specifically, postpartum depression. In the end, the 
      most promising opportunities they represent (e.g., clinical tasks augmentation, 
      personalized healthcare, etc.) and related concerns (e.g., data privacy and 
      quality, fairness, etc.) are discussed to contribute to the global debate on 
      their integration in the sanitary system.

LID - zvad120 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/eurjcn/zvad120 [doi]
AB  - Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have emerged as potential 
      game-changers in nursing, aiding in patient education, diagnostic assistance, 
      treatment recommendations, and administrative task efficiency. While these 
      advancements signal promising strides in healthcare, integrated LLMs are not 
      without challenges, particularly artificial intelligence hallucination and data 
      privacy concerns. Methodologies such as prompt engineering, temperature 
      adjustments, model fine-tuning, and local deployment are proposed to refine the 
      accuracy of LLMs and ensure data security. While LLMs offer transformative 
      potential, it is imperative to acknowledge that they cannot substitute the 
      intricate expertise of human professionals in the clinical field, advocating for 
      a synergistic approach in patient care.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of NCLEX-RN Questions: A Duel Between ChatGPT and Human 
      Expertise.
PG  - 679-687
LID - 10.3928/01484834-20231006-07 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize 
      nursing education. This study compared NCLEX-RN questions generated by AI and 
      those created by nurse educators. METHOD: Faculty of accredited baccalaureate 
      programs were invited to participate. Likert-scale items for grammar and clarity 
      of the item stem and distractors were compared using Mann-Whitney U, and yes/no 
      questions about clinical relevance and complex terminology were analyzed using 
      chi-square. A one-sample binomial test with confidence intervals evaluated 
      participants' question preference (AI-generated or educator-written). Qualitative 
      responses identified themes across faculty. RESULTS: Item clarity, grammar, and 
      difficulty were similar for AI and educator-created questions. Clinical relevance 
      and use of complex terminology was similar for all question pairs. Of the four 
      sets with preference for one item, three were generated by AI. CONCLUSION: AI can 
      assist faculty with item generation to prepare nursing students for the NCLEX-RN 
      examination. Faculty expertise is necessary to refine questions written using 
      both methods. [J Nurs Educ. 2023;62(12):679-687.].

TI  - Comparison of Ophthalmologist and Large Language Model Chatbot Responses to 
      Online Patient Eye Care Questions.
PG  - e2330320
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.30320 [doi]
LID - e2330320
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT appear capable of 
      performing a variety of tasks, including answering patient eye care questions, 
      but have not yet been evaluated in direct comparison with ophthalmologists. It 
      remains unclear whether LLM-generated advice is accurate, appropriate, and safe 
      for eye patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the quality of ophthalmology advice 
      generated by an LLM chatbot in comparison with ophthalmologist-written advice. 
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used deidentified 
      data from an online medical forum, in which patient questions received responses 
      written by American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO)-affiliated ophthalmologists. A 
      masked panel of 8 board-certified ophthalmologists were asked to distinguish 
      between answers generated by the ChatGPT chatbot and human answers. Posts were 
      dated between 2007 and 2016; data were accessed January 2023 and analysis was 
      performed between March and May 2023. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Identification 
      of chatbot and human answers on a 4-point scale (likely or definitely artificial 
      intelligence [AI] vs likely or definitely human) and evaluation of responses for 
      presence of incorrect information, alignment with perceived consensus in the 
      medical community, likelihood to cause harm, and extent of harm. RESULTS: A total 
      of 200 pairs of user questions and answers by AAO-affiliated ophthalmologists 
      were evaluated. The mean (SD) accuracy for distinguishing between AI and human 
      responses was 61.3% (9.7%). Of 800 evaluations of chatbot-written answers, 168 
      answers (21.0%) were marked as human-written, while 517 of 800 human-written 
      answers (64.6%) were marked as AI-written. Compared with human answers, chatbot 
      answers were more frequently rated as probably or definitely written by AI 
      (prevalence ratio [PR], 1.72; 95% CI, 1.52-1.93). The likelihood of chatbot 
      answers containing incorrect or inappropriate material was comparable with human 
      answers (PR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.77-1.10), and did not differ from human answers in 
      terms of likelihood of harm (PR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.67-1.07) nor extent of harm (PR, 
      0.99; 95% CI, 0.80-1.22). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional 
      study of human-written and AI-generated responses to 200 eye care questions from 
      an online advice forum, a chatbot appeared capable of responding to long 
      user-written eye health posts and largely generated appropriate responses that 
      did not differ significantly from ophthalmologist-written responses in terms of 
      incorrect information, likelihood of harm, extent of harm, or deviation from 
      ophthalmologist community standards. Additional research is needed to assess 
      patient attitudes toward LLM-augmented ophthalmologists vs fully autonomous AI 
      content generation, to evaluate clarity and acceptability of LLM-generated 
      answers from the patient perspective, to test the performance of LLMs in a 
      greater variety of clinical contexts, and to determine an optimal manner of 
      utilizing LLMs that is ethical and minimizes harm.

TI  - Stratified Evaluation of GPT's Question Answering in Surgery Reveals Artificial 
      Intelligence (AI) Knowledge Gaps.
PG  - e48788

AB  - Large&nbsp;language models (LLMs) have broad potential applications in medicine, such 
      as aiding with education, providing reassurance to patients, and supporting 
      clinical decision-making. However, there is a notable gap in understanding their 
      applicability and performance in the surgical domain and how their performance 
      varies across specialties. This paper aims to evaluate the performance of LLMs in 
      answering surgical questions relevant to clinical practice and to assess how this 
      performance varies across different surgical specialties. We used the MedMCQA 
      dataset, a large-scale multi-choice question-answer (MCQA) dataset consisting of 
      clinical questions across all areas of medicine. We extracted the relevant 23,035 
      surgical questions and submitted them to the popular LLMs Generative Pre-trained 
      Transformers (GPT)-3.5 and GPT-4 (OpenAI OpCo, LLC, San Francisco, CA). 
      Generative Pre-trained Transformer is a large language model that can generate 
      human-like text by predicting subsequent words in a sentence based on the context 
      of the words that come before it. It is pre-trained on a diverse range of texts 
      and can perform a variety of tasks, such as answering questions, without needing 
      task-specific training. The question-answering accuracy of GPT was calculated and 
      compared between the two models and across surgical specialties. Both GPT-3.5 and 
      GPT-4 achieved accuracies of 53.3% and 64.4%, respectively, on surgical 
      questions, showing a statistically significant difference in performance. When 
      compared to their performance on the full MedMCQA dataset, the two models 
      performed differently: GPT-4 performed worse on surgical questions than on the 
      dataset as a whole, while GPT-3.5 showed the opposite pattern. Significant 
      variations in accuracy were also observed across different surgical specialties, 
      with strong performances in anatomy, vascular, and paediatric surgery and worse 
      performances in orthopaedics, ENT, and neurosurgery. Large language models 
      exhibit promising capabilities in addressing surgical questions, although the 
      variability in their performance between specialties cannot be ignored. The lower 
      performance of the latest GPT-4 model on surgical questions relative to questions 
      across all medicine highlights the need for targeted improvements and continuous 
      updates to ensure relevance and accuracy in surgical applications. Further 
      research and continuous monitoring of LLM performance in surgical domains are 
      crucial to fully harnessing their potential and mitigating the risks of 
      misinformation.

LID - 2003
AB  - In recent times, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as a highly 
      promising modality for diagnosing severe diseases. Its exceptional spatiotemporal 
      resolution and ease of use have established it as an indispensable clinical 
      diagnostic tool. Nevertheless, there are instances where MRI encounters 
      challenges related to low contrast, necessitating the use of contrast agents 
      (CAs). Significant efforts have been made by scientists to enhance the precision 
      of observing diseased body parts by leveraging the synergistic potential of MRI 
      in conjunction with other imaging techniques and thereby modifying the CAs. In 
      this work, our focus is on elucidating the rational designing approach of CAs and 
      optimizing their compatibility for multimodal imaging and other intelligent 
      applications. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of incorporating various 
      artificial intelligence tools, such as machine learning and deep learning, to 
      explore the future prospects of disease diagnosis using MRI. We also address the 
      limitations associated with these techniques and propose reasonable remedies, 
      with the aim of advancing MRI as a cutting-edge diagnostic tool for the future.

TI  - Assessment of Resident and AI Chatbot Performance on the University of Toronto 
      Family Medicine Residency Progress Test: Comparative Study.
PG  - e50514
LID - 10.2196/50514 [doi]
LID - e50514
AB  - BACKGROUND: Large language model (LLM)-based chatbots are evolving at an 
      unprecedented pace with the release of ChatGPT, specifically GPT-3.5, and its 
      successor, GPT-4. Their capabilities in general-purpose tasks and language 
      generation have advanced to the point of performing excellently on various 
      educational examination benchmarks, including medical knowledge tests. Comparing 
      the performance of these 2 LLM models to that of Family Medicine residents on a 
      multiple-choice medical knowledge test can provide insights into their potential 
      as medical education tools. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to quantitatively and 
      qualitatively compare the performance of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Family Medicine 
      residents in a multiple-choice medical knowledge test appropriate for the level 
      of a Family Medicine resident. METHODS: An official University of Toronto 
      Department of Family and Community Medicine Progress Test consisting of 
      multiple-choice questions was inputted into GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. The artificial 
      intelligence chatbot's responses were manually reviewed to determine the selected 
      answer, response length, response time, provision of a rationale for the 
      outputted response, and the root cause of all incorrect responses (classified 
      into arithmetic, logical, and information errors). The performance of the 
      artificial intelligence chatbots were compared against a cohort of Family 
      Medicine residents who concurrently attempted the test. RESULTS: GPT-4 performed 
      significantly better compared to GPT-3.5 (difference 25.0%, 95% CI 16.3%-32.8%; 
      McNemar test: P&lt;.001); it correctly answered 89/108 (82.4%) questions, while 
      GPT-3.5 answered 62/108 (57.4%) questions correctly. Further, GPT-4 scored higher 
      across all 11 categories of Family Medicine knowledge. In 86.1% (n=93) of the 
      responses, GPT-4 provided a rationale for why other multiple-choice options were 
      not chosen compared to the 16.7% (n=18) achieved by GPT-3.5. Qualitatively, for 
      both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 responses, logical errors were the most common, while 
      arithmetic errors were the least common. The average performance of Family 
      Medicine residents was 56.9% (95% CI 56.2%-57.6%). The performance of GPT-3.5 was 
      similar to that of the average Family Medicine resident (P=.16), while the 
      performance of GPT-4 exceeded that of the top-performing Family Medicine resident 
      (P&lt;.001). CONCLUSIONS: GPT-4 significantly outperforms both GPT-3.5 and Family 
      Medicine residents on a multiple-choice medical knowledge test designed for 
      Family Medicine residents. GPT-4 provides a logical rationale for its response 
      choice, ruling out other answer choices efficiently and with concise 
      justification. Its high degree of accuracy and advanced reasoning capabilities 
      facilitate its potential applications in medical education, including the 
      creation of exam questions and scenarios as well as serving as a resource for 
      medical knowledge or information on community services.

AB  - The emergence of Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT), a chatbot 
      developed by OpenAI, has garnered interest in the application of generative 
      artificial intelligence (AI) models in the medical field. This review summarizes 
      different generative AI models and their potential applications in the field of 
      medicine and explores the evolving landscape of Generative Adversarial Networks 
      and diffusion models since the introduction of generative AI models. These models 
      have made valuable contributions to the field of radiology. Furthermore, this 
      review also explores the significance of synthetic data in addressing privacy 
      concerns and augmenting data diversity and quality within the medical domain, in 
      addition to emphasizing the role of inversion in the investigation of generative 
      models and outlining an approach to replicate this process. We provide an 
      overview of Large Language Models, such as GPTs and bidirectional encoder 
      representations (BERTs), that focus on prominent representatives and discuss 
      recent initiatives involving language-vision models in radiology, including 
      innovative large language and vision assistant for biomedicine (LLaVa-Med), to 
      illustrate their practical application. This comprehensive review offers insights 
      into the wide-ranging applications of generative AI models in clinical research 
      and emphasizes their transformative potential.

      Healing.
PG  - 182-192
LID - 10.1007/s11914-023-00850-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Fractures are a prominent form of traumatic injury and shall 
      continue to be for the foreseeable future. While the inflammatory response and 
      the cells of the bone marrow microenvironment play significant roles in fracture 
      healing, the nervous system is also an important player in regulating bone 
      healing. RECENT FINDINGS: Considerable evidence demonstrates a role for nervous 
      system regulation of fracture healing in a setting of traumatic injury to the 
      brain. Although many of the impacts of the nervous system on fracture healing are 
      positive, pain mediated by the nervous system can have detrimental effects on 
      mobilization and quality of life. Understanding the role the nervous system plays 
      in fracture healing is vital to understanding fracture healing as a whole and 
      improving quality of life post-injury.&nbsp;This review article is part of a series of 
      multiple manuscripts designed to determine the utility of using artificial 
      intelligence for writing scientific reviews.

TI  - Fine-tuning Large Language Models for Rare Disease Concept Normalization.
LID - 2023.12.28.573586 [pii]
LID - 10.1101/2023.12.28.573586 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aim to develop a solution for rare disease concept normalization 
      based on fine-tuning LLaMA 2, an open-source large language model (LLM), using a 
      domain-specific corpus. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We fine-tuned four LLaMA2 models, 
      each comprising seven billion parameters, using sentences incorporating clinical 
      concepts from the HPO and OMIM vocabularies. The fine-tuning was conducted on 
      four NVIDIA A100 GPUs. RESULTS: All models proved resilient to newly 
      prompt-engineered sentences not used in the fine-tuning, achieved nearly perfect 
      accuracies when prompted with original training data, and exhibit some robustness 
      to typos. We tested each model on concepts they had not been trained on. The 
      non-synonym HPO model fine-tuned without synonyms achieved 25.2% accuracy, while 
      the synonym HPO model, fine-tuned with half the synonyms, achieved 85.6% 
      accuracy. When tested against concept synonyms from SNOMED-CT, the non-synonym 
      model achieved an accuracy of 33.9% while the synonym model improved to 57.4%. 
      Synonyms proved challenging to both non-synonym and synonym OMIM models. ChatGPT 
      3.5 correctly identified HPO IDs for four out of 20 prompts. DISCUSSION: Our 
      increasingly fine-tuned models demonstrated growing robustness to challenges such 
      as misspellings, synonyms, and concepts from other ontologies. Incorrect outputs 
      stem from tokens in the input that the models have never encountered, such as 
      parenthesis. Many synonyms do not share the same semantic meaning and often 
      include abbreviations. CONCLUSION: Our fine-tuned LLaMA 2 models provide the 
      capability to identify variations in medical concepts from clinical narratives 
      while successfully normalizing them to a standard concept.

TI  - Chatbots and Large Language Models in Radiology: A Practical Primer for Clinical 
      and Research Applications.
PG  - e232756
LID - 10.1148/radiol.232756 [doi]
AB  - Although chatbots have existed for decades, the emergence of transformer-based 
      large language models (LLMs) has captivated the world through the most recent 
      wave of artificial intelligence chatbots, including ChatGPT. Transformers are a 
      type of neural network architecture that enables better contextual understanding 
      of language and efficient training on massive amounts of unlabeled data, such as 
      unstructured text from the internet. As LLMs have increased in size, their 
      improved performance and emergent abilities have revolutionized natural language 
      processing. Since language is integral to human thought, applications based on 
      LLMs have transformative potential in many industries. In fact, LLM-based 
      chatbots have demonstrated human-level performance on many professional 
      benchmarks, including in radiology. LLMs offer numerous clinical and research 
      applications in radiology, several of which have been explored in the literature 
      with encouraging results. Multimodal LLMs can simultaneously interpret text and 
      images to generate reports, closely mimicking current diagnostic pathways in 
      radiology. Thus, from requisition to report, LLMs have the opportunity to 
      positively impact nearly every step of the radiology journey. Yet, these 
      impressive models are not without limitations. This article reviews the 
      limitations of LLMs and mitigation strategies, as well as potential uses of LLMs, 
      including multimodal models. Also reviewed are existing LLM-based applications 
      that can enhance efficiency in supervised settings.

TI  - AI-generated Patient Information Leaflets: a comparison of PIL contents to BAD 
      standards.
LID - llad461 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ced/llad461 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: PILs are a tool that can supplement a clinical consultation and 
      provide additional information for a patient to read in their own time. A wide 
      range of PILs are available for distribution by the BAD and undergo rigorous 
      review ahead of publication. 7.1 million UK adults are estimated to have the 
      reading age of a 9-year-old and 43% are unable to comprehend written health 
      information. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether AI can produce PILs that include a 
      similar degree of content to current BAD PILs. METHODS: Using the AI tool 
      ChatGPT, 10 PILs were generated, and their contents compared to that of existing 
      BAD PILs using an author-generated list of commonly included themes. Omissions 
      were noted and a repeat series of PILs generated using targeted request phrasing. 
      Readability of AI-generated PILs was also analysed. RESULTS: AI-generated PILs 
      were found to include similar factual content to BAD PILs but excluded 
      information that was felt to be more pertinent to patient concerns such as 
      curability and heritability. Targeted request phrasing saw AI generate PILs 
      including this content. Readability of AI-generated PILs was noted to be much 
      higher than that of UK adults. CONCLUSIONS: Where a condition-specific PIL is not 
      readily available an AI-generated PIL can provide relevant information to a 
      lesser quality than existing BAD PILs that may be inaccessible to some patients. 
      Specific caution is advised regarding AI-generated medication-specific PILs.

TI  - Will Generative Artificial Intelligence Deliver on Its Promise in Health Care?
PG  - 65-69
LID - 10.1001/jama.2023.25054 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Since the introduction of ChatGPT in late 2022, generative artificial 
      intelligence (genAI) has elicited enormous enthusiasm and serious concerns. 
      OBSERVATIONS: History has shown that general purpose technologies often fail to 
      deliver their promised benefits for many years ("the productivity paradox of 
      information technology"). Health care has several attributes that make the 
      successful deployment of new technologies even more difficult than in other 
      industries; these have challenged prior efforts to implement AI and electronic 
      health records. However, genAI has unique properties that may shorten the usual 
      lag between implementation and productivity and/or quality gains in health care. 
      Moreover, the health care ecosystem has evolved to make it more receptive to 
      genAI, and many health care organizations are poised to implement the 
      complementary innovations in culture, leadership, workforce, and workflow often 
      needed for digital innovations to flourish. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The 
      ability of genAI to rapidly improve and the capacity of organizations to 
      implement complementary innovations that allow IT tools to reach their potential 
      are more advanced than in the past; thus, genAI is capable of delivering 
      meaningful improvements in health care more rapidly than was the case with 
      previous technologies.

AB  - Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable 
      successes in zero- and few-shot performance on various downstream tasks, paving 
      the way for applications in high-stakes domains. In this study, we systematically 
      examine the capabilities and limitations of LLMs, specifically GPT-3.5 and 
      ChatGPT, in performing zero-shot medical evidence summarization across six 
      clinical domains. We conduct both automatic and human evaluations, covering 
      several dimensions of summary quality. Our study has demonstrated that automatic 
      metrics often do not strongly correlate with the quality of summaries. 
      Furthermore, informed by our human evaluations, we define a terminology of error 
      types for medical evidence summarization. Our findings reveal that LLMs could be 
      susceptible to generating factually inconsistent summaries and making overly 
      convincing or uncertain statements, leading to potential harm due to 
      misinformation. Moreover, we find that models struggle to identify the salient 
      information and are more error-prone when summarizing over longer textual 
      contexts.

AB  - Within the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models 
      (LLMs) represent sophisticated models engineered to comprehend, generate, and 
      manipulate text resembling human language on an extensive scale. They are 
      transformer-based deep learning architectures, obtained through the scaling of 
      model size, pretraining of corpora, and computational resources. The potential 
      healthcare applications of these models primarily involve chatbots and 
      interaction systems for clinical documentation management, and medical literature 
      summarization (Biomedical NLP). The challenge in this field lies in the research 
      for applications in diagnostic and clinical decision support, as well as patient 
      triage. Therefore, LLMs can be used for multiple tasks within patient care, 
      research, and education. Throughout 2023, there has been an escalation in the 
      release of LLMs, some of which are applicable in the healthcare domain. This 
      remarkable output is largely the effect of the customization of pre-trained 
      models for applications like chatbots, virtual assistants, or any system 
      requiring human-like conversational engagement. As healthcare professionals, we 
      recognize the imperative to stay at the forefront of knowledge. However, keeping 
      abreast of the rapid evolution of this technology is practically unattainable, 
      and, above all, understanding its potential applications and limitations remains 
      a subject of ongoing debate. Consequently, this article aims to provide a 
      succinct overview of the recently released LLMs, emphasizing their potential use 
      in the field of medicine. Perspectives for a more extensive range of safe and 
      effective applications are also discussed. The upcoming evolutionary leap 
      involves the transition from an AI-powered model primarily designed for answering 
      medical questions to a more versatile and practical tool for healthcare providers 
      such as generalist biomedical AI systems for multimodal-based calibrated 
      decision-making processes. On the other hand, the development of more accurate 
      virtual clinical partners could enhance patient engagement, offering personalized 
      support, and improving chronic disease management.

AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform many 
      aspects of scholarly publishing. Authors, peer reviewers, and editors might use 
      AI in a variety of ways, and those uses might augment their existing work or 
      might instead be intended to replace it. We are editors of bioethics and 
      humanities journals who have been contemplating the implications of this ongoing 
      transformation. We believe that generative AI may pose a threat to the goals that 
      animate our work but could also be valuable for achieving those goals. In the 
      interests of fostering a wider conversation about how generative AI may be used, 
      we have developed a preliminary set of recommendations for its use in scholarly 
      publishing. We hope that the recommendations and rationales set out here will 
      help the scholarly community navigate toward a deeper understanding of the 
      strengths, limits, and challenges of AI for responsible scholarly work.

AB  - Introduction This study aimed to identify predictive factors for successful 
      return to sports among elite female athletes (EFAs) experiencing stress urinary 
      incontinence (SUI). We used machine learning to analyze these predictors. Methods 
      This study was conducted at Yokosuka Urogynecology and Urology Clinic, located in 
      Yokosuka City, Kanagawa, Japan. A total of 153 EFAs with postpartum SUI were 
      included in this retrospective cohort study. Information regarding the frequency 
      of pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), treatment approaches, rates of return to 
      sports after one year, and one-hour pad test (1HrPadtest) at three months were 
      collected. Results At three months, 26.8% of the EFAs improved in SUI; after one 
      year, 28.1% returned to their respective sports successfully. The equation for 
      predicting return to sports (logit(p)) involved several factors: (a) serum total 
      testosterone, (b) PFMT frequency per week, (c) 1HrPadtest at three months, and 
      (d) vaginal erbium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser (VEL) + urethral EL (UEL) 
      treatment. The equation was as follows: -126 - 0.07276a + 25.98b - 1.947c - 
      25.32d, with a logit(p) cutoff point at 0.5. The optimal cutoff values and the 
      four influential factors were determined through a receiver operating 
      characteristic (ROC) analysis and the random forest model, respectively. 
      Conclusions For EFAs with severe SUI to successfully return to their sports 
      activities, the PFMT frequency was paramount. Patients who exhibited 
      unsatisfactory results in the 1HrPadtest at the three-month mark benefited from 
      the VEL+UEL treatment. Serum total testosterone proved to be an effective 
      discerning criterion.

AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise in 
      neurointerventional surgery by providing clinicians with powerful tools for 
      improving surgical precision, accuracy of diagnoses, and treatment planning. 
      However, potential perils include biases or inaccuracies in the data used to 
      train the algorithms, over-reliance on generative AI without human oversight, 
      patient privacy concerns, and ethical implications of using AI in medical 
      decision-making. Careful regulation and oversight are needed to ensure that the 
      promises of generative AI in neurointerventional surgery are realized while 
      minimizing its potential perils.[ChatGPT authored summary using the prompt "In

TI  - Relief in Sight? Chatbots, In-baskets, and the Overwhelmed Primary Care 
      Clinician.
PG  - 2808-2815
LID - 10.1007/s11606-023-08271-8 [doi]
AB  - The recent emergence of publically facing artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots 
      has generated vigorous discussion in the lay public around the possibilities, 
      liabilities, and uncertainties of the integration of such technology into 
      everyday life. As primary care clinicians continue to struggle against 
      ever-increasing loads of asynchronous, electronic work, the potential for AI to 
      improve the quality and efficiency of this work looms large. In this essay, we 
      discuss the basic premise of open-access AI chatbots such as CHATGPT, review 
      prior applications of AI in healthcare, and preview some possible AI 
      chatbot-assisted in-basket assistance including scenarios of communicating test 
      results with patients, providing patient education, and clinical decision support 
      in history taking, review of prior diagnostic test characteristics, and common 
      management scenarios. We discuss important concerns related to the future 
      adoption of this technology including the transparency of the training data used 
      in developing these models, the level of oversight and trustworthiness of the 
      information generated, and possible impacts on equity, bias, and patient privacy. 
      A stepwise and balanced approach to simultaneously understand the capabilities 
      and address the concerns associated with these tools will be needed before these 
      tools can improve patient care.

TI  - Holistic Evaluation of Language Models.
PG  - 140-146
LID - 10.1111/nyas.15007 [doi]
AB  - Language models (LMs) like GPT-3, PaLM, and ChatGPT are the foundation for almost 
      all major language technologies, but their capabilities, limitations, and risks 
      are not well understood. We present Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) 
      to improve the transparency of LMs. LMs can serve many purposes and their 
      behavior should satisfy many desiderata. To navigate the vast space of potential 
      scenarios and metrics, we taxonomize the space and select representative subsets. 
      We evaluate models on 16 core scenarios and 7 metrics, exposing important 
      trade-offs. We supplement our core evaluation with seven targeted evaluations to 
      deeply analyze specific aspects (including world knowledge, reasoning, 
      regurgitation of copyrighted content, and generation of disinformation). We 
      benchmark 30 LMs, from OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Meta, Cohere, AI21 Labs, and 
      others. Prior to HELM, models were evaluated on just 17.9% of the core HELM 
      scenarios, with some prominent models not sharing a single scenario in common. We 
      improve this to 96.0%: all 30 models are now benchmarked under the same 
      standardized conditions. Our evaluation surfaces 25 top-level findings. For full 
      transparency, we release all raw model prompts and completions publicly. HELM is 
      a living benchmark for the community, continuously updated with new scenarios, 
      metrics, and models https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/latest/.

AB  - We administer a Turing test to AI chatbots. We examine how chatbots behave in a 
      suite of classic behavioral games that are designed to elicit characteristics 
      such as trust, fairness, risk-aversion, cooperation, etc., as well as how they 
      respond to a traditional Big-5 psychological survey that measures personality 
      traits. ChatGPT-4 exhibits behavioral and personality traits that are 
      statistically indistinguishable from a random human from tens of thousands of 
      human subjects from more than 50 countries. Chatbots also modify their behavior 
      based on previous experience and contexts "as if" they were learning from the 
      interactions and change their behavior in response to different framings of the 
      same strategic situation. Their behaviors are often distinct from average and 
      modal human behaviors, in which case they tend to behave on the more altruistic 
      and cooperative end of the distribution. We estimate that they act as if they are 
      maximizing an average of their own and partner's payoffs.

PG  - 709-716
LID - 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.124.19468 [doi]
AB  - Hypertension, a leading cause of cardiovascular disease and premature death, 
      remains incompletely understood despite extensive research. Indeed, even though 
      numerous drugs are available, achieving adequate blood pressure control remains a 
      challenge, prompting recent interest in artificial intelligence. To promote the 
      use of machine learning in cardiovascular medicine, this review provides a brief 
      introduction to machine learning and reviews its notable applications in 
      hypertension management and research, such as disease diagnosis and prognosis, 
      treatment decisions, and omics data analysis. The challenges and limitations 
      associated with data-driven predictive techniques are also discussed. The goal of 
      this review is to raise awareness and encourage the hypertension research 
      community to consider machine learning as a key component in developing 
      innovative diagnostic and therapeutic tools for hypertension. By integrating 
      traditional cardiovascular risk factors with genomics, socioeconomic, behavioral, 
      and environmental factors, machine learning may aid in the development of precise 
      risk prediction models and personalized treatment approaches for patients with 
      hypertension.

AB  - The emergence of publicly accessible artificial intelligence (AI) large language 
      models such as ChatGPT has given rise to global conversations on the implications 
      of AI capabilities. Emergent research on AI has challenged the assumption that 
      creative potential is a uniquely human trait thus, there seems to be a disconnect 
      between human perception versus what AI is objectively capable of creating. Here, 
      we aimed to assess the creative potential of humans in comparison to AI. In the 
      present study, human participants (Nâ=â151) and GPT-4 provided responses for the 
      Alternative Uses Task, Consequences Task, and Divergent Associations Task. We 
      found that AI was robustly more creative along each divergent thinking 
      measurement in comparison to the human counterparts. Specifically, when 
      controlling for fluency of responses, AI was more original and elaborate. The 
      present findings suggest that the current state of AI language models demonstrate 
      higher creative potential than human respondents.

TI  - Enabling AI in synthetic biology through Construction File specification.
PG  - e0294469
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0294469 [doi]
LID - e0294469
AB  - The Construction File (CF) specification establishes a standardized interface for 
      molecular biology operations, laying a foundation for automation and enhanced 
      efficiency in experiment design. It is implemented across three distinct software 
      projects: PyDNA_CF_Simulator, a Python project featuring a ChatGPT plugin for 
      interactive parsing and simulating experiments; ConstructionFileSimulator, a 
      field-tested Java project that showcases 'Experiment' objects expressed as flat 
      files; and C6-Tools, a JavaScript project integrated with Google Sheets via Apps 
      Script, providing a user-friendly interface for authoring and simulation of CF. 
      The CF specification not only standardizes and modularizes molecular biology 
      operations but also promotes collaboration, automation, and reuse, significantly 
      reducing potential errors. The potential integration of CF with artificial 
      intelligence, particularly GPT-4, suggests innovative automation strategies for 
      synthetic biology. While challenges such as token limits, data storage, and 
      biosecurity remain, proposed solutions promise a way forward in harnessing AI for 
      experiment design. This shift from human-driven design to AI-assisted workflows, 
      steered by high-level objectives, charts a potential future path in synthetic 
      biology, envisioning an environment where complexities are managed more 
      effectively.

TI  - Can ChatGPT Answer Patient Questions Regarding Total Knee Arthroplasty?
LID - 10.1055/s-0044-1782233 [doi]
AB  - The internet has introduced many resources frequently accessed by patients prior 
      to orthopaedic visits. Recently, Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer, an 
      artificial intelligence-based chat application, has become publicly and freely 
      available. The interface uses deep learning technology to mimic human interaction 
      and provide convincing answers to questions posed by users. With its rapidly 
      expanding usership, it is reasonable to assume that patients will soon use this 
      technology for preoperative education. Therefore, we sought to determine the 
      accuracy of answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) pertaining to total knee 
      arthroplasty (TKA).Ten FAQs were posed to the chatbot during a single online 
      interaction with no follow-up questions or repetition. All 10 FAQs were analyzed 
      for accuracy using an evidence-based approach. Answers were then rated as 
      "excellent response not requiring clarification," "satisfactory requiring minimal 
      clarification," satisfactory requiring moderate clarification," or 
      "unsatisfactory requiring substantial clarification."Of the 10 answers given by 
      the chatbot, none received an "unsatisfactory" rating with the majority either 
      requiring minimal (5) or moderate (4) clarification. While many answers required 
      nuanced clarification, overall, answers tended to be unbiased and evidence-based, 
      even when presented with controversial subjects.The chatbot does an excellent job 
      of providing basic, evidence-based answers to patient FAQs prior to TKA. These 
      data were presented in a manner that will be easily comprehendible by most 
      patients and may serve as a useful clinical adjunct in the future.

AB  - Natural language processing (NLP), a subclass of artificial intelligence, large 
      language models (LLMs), and its latest applications, such as Generative 
      Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), ChatGPT, or LLAMA, have recently become one of 
      the most discussed topics. Up to now, artificial intelligence and NLP ultimately 
      impacted several areas, such as finance, economics and diagnostic/scoring systems 
      in healthcare. Another area that artificial intelligence has affected and will 
      continue to affect increasingly is academic life. This narrative review will 
      define NLP, LLMs and their applications, discuss the opportunities and challenges 
      that components of academic society will experience in rheumatology, and discuss 
      the impact of NLP and LLMs in rheumatology healthcare.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools have experienced rapid 
      development over the last decade and are gaining increasing popularity as 
      assistive models in academic writing. However, the ability of AI to generate 
      reliable and accurate research articles is a topic of debate. Major scientific 
      journals have issued policies regarding the contribution of AI tools in 
      scientific writing. METHODS: We conducted a review of the author and peer 
      reviewer guidelines of the top 25 Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine journals 
      as per the 2023 SCImago rankings. Data were obtained though reviewing journal 
      websites and directly emailing the editorial office. Descriptive data regarding 
      journal characteristics were coded on SPSS. Subgroup analyses of the journal 
      guidelines were conducted based on the publishing company policies. RESULTS: Our 
      analysis revealed that all scientific journals in our study permitted the 
      documented use of AI in scientific writing with certain limitations as per ICMJE 
      recommendations. We found that AI tools cannot be included in the authorship or 
      be used for image generation, and that all authors are required to assume full 
      responsibility of their submitted and published work. The use of generative AI 
      tools in the peer review process is strictly prohibited. CONCLUSION: Guidelines 
      regarding the use of generative AI in scientific writing are standardized, 
      detailed, and unanimously followed by all journals in our study according to the 
      recommendations set forth by international forums. It is imperative to ensure 
      that these policies are carefully followed and updated to maintain scientific 
      integrity.

AB  - The integration of large language models (LLMs), such as those in the Generative 
      Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) series, into medical education has the potential 
      to transform learning experiences for students and elevate their knowledge, 
      skills, and competence. Drawing on a wealth of professional and academic 
      experience, we propose that LLMs hold promise for revolutionizing medical 
      curriculum development, teaching methodologies, personalized study plans and 
      learning materials, student assessments, and more. However, we also critically 
      examine the challenges that such integration might pose by addressing issues of 
      algorithmic bias, overreliance, plagiarism, misinformation, inequity, privacy, 
      and copyright concerns in medical education. As we navigate the shift from an 
      information-driven educational paradigm to an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven 
      educational paradigm, we argue that it is paramount to understand both the 
      potential and the pitfalls of LLMs in medical education. This paper thus offers 
      our perspective on the opportunities and challenges of using LLMs in this 
      context. We believe that the insights gleaned from this analysis will serve as a 
      foundation for future recommendations and best practices in the field, fostering 
      the responsible and effective use of AI technologies in medical education.

TI  - Laboratory Findings of Benign Convulsions With Mild Gastroenteritis: A 
      Meta-Analysis.
PG  - e36784
LID - 10.7759/cureus.36784 [doi]
LID - e36784
AB  - Investigating factors associated with benign convulsions with mild 
      gastroenteritis (CwG) is important for early detection and treatment. In previous 
      studies, uric acid (UA) has been reported to be associated with CwG. However, the 
      association between CwG and abnormal laboratory values remains inconclusive. We 
      performed a meta-analysis of recent reports to determine the association between 
      CwG and laboratory findings, including UA, in patients with acute gastroenteritis 
      without convulsions. We conducted electronic searches of three databases (PubMed, 
      EMBASE, and Cochrane Library) and one scholarly search engine (Google Scholar 
      (Google, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA)) up to February 2023 for studies on CwG. 
      Eligible studies were observational studies that assessed patients with CwG, 
      reported laboratory data, and stated the presence or absence of convulsions 
      during illness episodes. Patients were children with mild gastroenteritis, with 
      the exposure group developing convulsions and the control group not. The outcome 
      was a comparison of laboratory data between the two groups. The effect size was 
      calculated using the standardized mean difference (SMD), and random-effects 
      models were used for the analysis because of high heterogeneity. In total, 148 
      articles were included in this study. After the screening, nine studies, 
      including 8,367 patients, were selected for the meta-analysis. The most prevalent 
      laboratory finding was an increased serum UA level, with an SMD&nbsp;of 1.42&nbsp;(N = 
      6,411; 95% confidence interval (CI): (1.12, 1.72); Z = 9.242, p&lt; 0.001;&nbsp;I (2) = 
      81.68%, p= 0.002). The optimal serum UA cutoff value was 7.21 mg/dL, with an area 
      under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.827 (95% CI: 
      (0.807, 0.846)). This meta-analysis suggests that CwG is strongly associated with 
      increased serum UA levels. These results demonstrate that more attention should 
      be paid when interpreting laboratory findings in pediatric patients with acute 
      gastroenteritis.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and 
      chatbots have brought these technologies to the forefront of medicine, 
      particularly ophthalmology. These technologies have been applied in diagnosis, 
      prognosis, surgical operations, and patient-specific care in ophthalmology. It is 
      thus both timely and pertinent to assess the existing landscape, recent advances, 
      and trajectory of trends of AI, AI-enabled robots, and chatbots in ophthalmology. 
      RECENT FINDINGS: Some recent developments have integrated AI enabled robotics 
      with diagnosis, and surgical procedures in ophthalmology. More recently, large 
      language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown promise in augmenting research 
      capabilities and diagnosing ophthalmic diseases. These developments may portend a 
      new era of doctor-patient-machine collaboration. SUMMARY: Ophthalmology is 
      undergoing a revolutionary change in research, clinical practice, and surgical 
      interventions. Ophthalmic AI-enabled robotics and chatbot technologies based on 
      LLMs are converging to create a new era of digital ophthalmology. Collectively, 
      these developments portend a future in which conventional ophthalmic knowledge 
      will be seamlessly integrated with AI to improve the patient experience and 
      enhance therapeutic outcomes.

      Texts: A Preliminary Study.
PG  - e319
LID - 10.3346/jkms.2023.38.e319 [doi]
LID - e319
AB  - BACKGROUND: With emergence of chatbots to help authors with scientific writings, 
      editors should have tools to identify artificial intelligence-generated texts. 
      GPTZero is among the first websites that has sought media attention claiming to 
      differentiate machine-generated from human-written texts. METHODS: Using 20 text 
      pieces generated by ChatGPT in response to arbitrary questions on various topics 
      in medicine and 30 pieces chosen from previously published medical articles, the 
      performance of GPTZero was assessed. RESULTS: GPTZero had a sensitivity of 0.65 
      (95% confidence interval, 0.41-0.85); specificity, 0.90 (0.73-0.98); accuracy, 
      0.80 (0.66-0.90); and positive and negative likelihood ratios, 6.5 (2.1-19.9) and 
      0.4 (0.2-0.7), respectively. CONCLUSION: GPTZero has a low false-positive 
      (classifying a human-written text as machine-generated) and a high false-negative 
      rate (classifying a machine-generated text as human-written).

BTI - Artificial Intelligence in Prehospital Emergency Health Care: CADTH Horizon Scan
AB  - WHAT IS THE ISSUE? Health care systems in Canada, including prehospital emergency 
      health care services, are facing staffing shortages and increased patient 
      volumes, and are looking for creative solutions to ensure the provision of 
      high-quality care. WHAT IS THE TECHNOLOGY? Artificial intelligence (AI) combines 
      computer science and data to mimic human thought processes, problem solving, and 
      responses. AI relies on statistical models, algorithms, data analysis, and 
      machine learning to make predictions based on past behaviours or results 
      (predictive AI) or to learn from past data to generate new content (generative 
      AI). Chatbots, such as ChatGPT, are examples of generative AI. WHAT IS THE 
      POTENTIAL IMPACT? In health care settings, AI can be used to automate some 
      clinical and administrative processes to create efficiencies and reduce burden on 
      health care providers and health administrators. In a prehospital setting, this 
      can include AI used at the dispatch stage (e.g., analyzing the conversation and 
      prompting a dispatcher with additional questions, or translating speech to help a 
      dispatcher understand a caller in real time) or in an ambulance (e.g., providing 
      traffic analysis or information to support optimal patient management). WHAT ELSE 
      DO WE KEED TO KNOW? The use of AI in prehospital emergency health care is still 
      in the early stages of development and implementation. Early implementation of AI 
      programs such as those to detect out of hospital cardiac events and to triage 
      emergency calls during peak times are underway in some countries. . More 
      real-world clinical trials and research are required before widespread 
      implementation will take place.

AB  - This critique explores the implications of integrating artificial intelligence 
      (AI) technology, specifically OpenAI's advanced language model GPT-4 and its 
      interface, ChatGPT, into the field of spinal surgery. It examines the potential 
      effects of algorithmic bias, unique challenges in surgical domains, access and 
      equity issues, cost implications, global disparities in technology adoption, and 
      the concept of technological determinism. It posits that biases present in AI 
      training data may impact the quality and equity of healthcare outcomes. 
      Challenges related to the unique nature of surgical procedures, including 
      real-time decision-making, are also addressed. Concerns over access, equity, and 
      cost implications underscore the potential for exacerbated healthcare 
      disparities. Global disparities in technology adoption highlight the importance 
      of global collaboration, technology transfer, and capacity building. Finally, the 
      critique challenges the notion of technological determinism, emphasizing the 
      continued importance of human judgement and patient-care provider relationship in 
      healthcare. The critique calls for a comprehensive evaluation of AI technology 
      integration in healthcare to ensure equitable and quality care.

TI  - Understanding computational dialogue understanding.
PG  - 20220049
LID - 10.1098/rsta.2022.0049 [doi]
AB  - In this paper, we first explain why human-like dialogue understanding is so 
      difficult for artificial intelligence (AI). We discuss various methods for 
      testing the understanding capabilities of dialogue systems. Our review of the 
      development of dialogue systems over five decades focuses on the transition from 
      closed-domain to open-domain systems and their extension to multi-modal, 
      multi-party and multi-lingual dialogues. From being somewhat of a niche topic of 
      AI research for the first 40 years, it has made newspaper headlines in recent 
      years and is now being discussed by political leaders at events such as the World 
      Economic Forum in Davos. We ask whether large language models are super-parrots 
      or a milestone towards human-like dialogue understanding and how they relate to 
      what we know about language processing in the human brain. Using ChatGPT as an 
      example, we present some limitations of this approach to dialogue systems. 
      Finally, we present some lessons learned from our 40 years of research in this 
      field about system architecture principles: symmetric multi-modality, no 
      presentation without representation and anticipation feedback loops. We conclude 
      with a discussion of grand challenges such as satisfying conversational maxims 
      and the European Language Equality Act through massive digital 
      multi-linguality-perhaps enabled by interactive machine learning with human 
      trainers. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Cognitive 
      artificial intelligence'.

TI  - A comparison of cover letters written by ChatGPT-4 or humans.
LID - A06230412 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Artificial intelligence has started to become a part of scientific 
      studies and may help researchers with a wide range of tasks. However, no 
      scientific studies have been published on its ussefulness in writing cover 
      letters for scientific articles. This study aimed to determine whether Generative 
      Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT)-4 is as good as humans in writing cover letters for 
      scientific papers. METHODS: In this randomised non-inferiority study, we included 
      two parallel arms consisting of cover letters written by humans and by GPT-4. 
      Each arm had 18 cover letters, which were assessed by three different blinded 
      assessors. The assessors completed a questionnaire in which they had to assess 
      the cover letters with respect to impression, readability, criteria satisfaction, 
      and degree of detail. Subsequently, we performed readability tests with Lix score 
      and Flesch Kincaid grade level. RESULTS: No significant or relevant difference 
      was found on any parameter. A total of 61% of the blinded assessors guessed 
      correctly as to whether the cover letter was written by GPT-4 or a human. GPT-4 
      had a higher score according to our objective readability tests. Nevertheless, it 
      performed better than human writing on readability in the subjective assessments. 
      CONCLUSION: We found that GPT-4 was non-inferior at writing cover letters 
      compared to humans. This may be used to streamline cover letters for researchers, 
      providing an equal chance to all researchers for advancement to peer-review. 
      FUNDING: This study received no financial support from external sources. TRIAL 
      REGISTRATION: This study was not registered before the study commenced.

PG  - 6074-6087
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2023.3316750 [doi]
AB  - Large AI models, or foundation models, are models recently emerging with massive 
      scales both parameter-wise and data-wise, the magnitudes of which can reach 
      beyond billions. Once pretrained, large AI models demonstrate impressive 
      performance in various downstream tasks. A prime example is ChatGPT, whose 
      capability has compelled people's imagination about the far-reaching influence 
      that large AI models can have and their potential to transform different domains 
      of our lives. In health informatics, the advent of large AI models has brought 
      new paradigms for the design of methodologies. The scale of multi-modal data in 
      the biomedical and health domain has been ever-expanding especially since the 
      community embraced the era of deep learning, which provides the ground to 
      develop, validate, and advance large AI models for breakthroughs in 
      health-related areas. This article presents a comprehensive review of large AI 
      models, from background to their applications. We identify seven key sectors in 
      which large AI models are applicable and might have substantial influence, 
      including: 1) bioinformatics; 2) medical diagnosis; 3) medical imaging; 4) 
      medical informatics; 5) medical education; 6) public health; and 7) medical 
      robotics. We examine their challenges, followed by a critical discussion about 
      potential future directions and pitfalls of large AI models in transforming the 
      field of health informatics.

TI  - KRP-DS: A Knowledge Graph-Based Dialogue System with Inference-Aided Prediction.
LID - 10.3390/s23156805 [doi]
LID - 6805
AB  - With the popularity of ChatGPT, there has been increasing attention towards 
      dialogue systems. Researchers are dedicated to designing a knowledgeable model 
      that can engage in conversations like humans. Traditional seq2seq dialogue models 
      often suffer from limited performance and the issue of generating safe responses. 
      In recent years, large-scale pretrained language models have demonstrated their 
      powerful capabilities across various domains. Many studies have leveraged these 
      pretrained models for dialogue tasks to address concerns such as safe response 
      generation. Pretrained models can enhance responses by carrying certain knowledge 
      information after being pre-trained on large-scale data. However, when specific 
      knowledge is required in a particular domain, the model may still generate bland 
      or inappropriate responses, and the interpretability of such models is poor. 
      Therefore, in this paper, we propose the KRP-DS model. We design a knowledge 
      module that incorporates a knowledge graph as external knowledge in the dialogue 
      system. The module utilizes contextual information for path reasoning and guides 
      knowledge prediction. Finally, the predicted knowledge is used to enhance 
      response generation. Experimental results show that our proposed model can 
      effectively improve the quality and diversity of responses while having better 
      interpretability, and outperforms baseline models in both automatic and human 
      evaluations.

AB  - As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to evolve and mature, it is 
      increasingly finding applications in the field of healthcare, particularly in 
      specialties like radiology that are data-heavy and image-focused. Language 
      learning models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's Generative Pre-trained Transformer-4 
      (GPT-4) are new in the field of medicine and there is a paucity of literature 
      regarding the possible utilities of GPT-4 given its novelty. We aim to present an 
      in-depth exploration of the role of GPT-4, an advanced language model, in 
      radiology. Giving the&nbsp;GPT-4 model prompts for generating reports, template 
      generation, enhancing clinical decision-making, and suggesting captivating titles 
      for research articles, patient communication, and education, can occasionally be 
      quite generic, and at times, it may present factually incorrect content, which 
      could lead to errors. The responses were then analyzed in detail regarding their 
      potential utility in day-to-day radiologist workflow, patient education, and 
      research processes. Further research is required to evaluate LLMs' accuracy and 
      safety in clinical practice and to develop comprehensive guidelines for their 
      implementation.

AB  - Biomedical engineering is a relatively young interdisciplinary field based on 
      engineering, biology, and medicine. Of note, the rapid progress of artificial 
      intelligence (AI)-based technologies has made a significant impact on the 
      biomedical engineering field, and continuously bring innovations and 
      breakthroughs. Recently, ChatGPT, an AI chatbot developed by OpenAI company, has 
      gained tremendous attention due to its powerful natural language generation and 
      understanding ability. In this study, we explored potential of GPT-4 in the eight 
      branches of biomedical engineering including medical imaging, medical devices, 
      bioinformatics, biomaterials, biomechanics, gene and cell engineering, tissue 
      engineering, and neural engineering. Our results show that the application of 
      GPT-4 will bring new opportunities for the development of this field.

TI  - The Potential of GPT-4 as an AI-Powered Virtual Assistant for Surgeons 
      Specialized in Joint Arthroplasty.
PG  - 1366-1370
LID - 10.1007/s10439-023-03207-z [doi]
AB  - The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) offers unprecedented opportunities 
      for joint arthroplasty surgery. Notably, on 14th March, 2023, the OpenAI company 
      officially launched its latest version GPT-4, which once again become the focus 
      of discussion on social media. Although more than 200 articles have reported the 
      potential role of ChatGPT/GPT-4 in&nbsp;various areas, there are no studies that 
      discussed the potential of GPT-4 as an AI-powered virtual assistant for surgeons 
      specialized in joint arthroplasty. In this study, we summarized the five major 
      roles of GPT-4 including scientific research, disease diagnosis, treatment 
      options, preoperative planning, intraoperative support, and postoperative 
      rehabilitation for arthroplasty doctors. Of note, in parallel to enjoy AI 
      dividend, it is also necessary to pay attention to protect the data from misuse 
      with ethical considerations in place.

TI  - Digitally Assisted Mindfulness in Training Self-Regulation Skills for Sustainable 
      Mental Health: A Systematic Review.
LID - 10.3390/bs13121008 [doi]
LID - 1008
AB  - The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increased demand for mental 
      health interventions, with a special focus on digitally assisted ones. 
      Self-regulation describes a set of meta-skills that enable one to take control 
      over his/her mental health and it is recognized as a vital indicator of 
      well-being. Mindfulness training is a promising training strategy for promoting 
      self-regulation, behavioral change, and mental well-being. A growing body of 
      research outlines that smart technologies are ready to revolutionize the way 
      mental health training programs take place. Artificial intelligence (AI); 
      extended reality (XR) including virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and 
      mixed reality (MR); as well as the advancements in brain computer interfaces 
      (BCIs) are ready to transform these mental health training programs. 
      Mindfulness-based interventions assisted by smart technologies for mental, 
      emotional, and behavioral regulation seem to be a crucial yet under-investigated 
      issue. The current systematic review paper aims to explore whether and how smart 
      technologies can assist mindfulness training for the development of 
      self-regulation skills among people at risk of mental health issues as well as 
      populations with various clinical characteristics. The PRISMA 2020 methodology 
      was utilized to respond to the objectives and research questions using a total of 
      sixty-six experimental studies that met the inclusion criteria. The results 
      showed that digitally assisted mindfulness interventions supported by smart 
      technologies, including AI-based applications, chatbots, virtual coaches, 
      immersive technologies, and brain-sensing headbands, can effectively assist 
      trainees in developing a wide range of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral 
      self-regulation skills, leading to a greater satisfaction of their psychological 
      needs, and thus mental wellness. These results may provide positive feedback for 
      developing smarter and more inclusive training environments, with a special focus 
      on people with special training needs or disabilities.

AB  - Rapid development and adoption of natural language processing (NLP) techniques 
      has led to a multitude of exciting and innovative societal and health care 
      applications. These advancements have also generated concerns around perpetuation 
      of historical injustices and that these tools lack cultural considerations. While 
      traditional health care NLP techniques typically include clinical subject matter 
      experts to extract health information or aid in interpretation, few NLP tools 
      involve community stakeholders with lived experiences. In this perspective paper, 
      we draw upon the field of community-based participatory research, which gathers 
      input from community members for development of public health interventions, to 
      identify and examine ways to equitably involve communities in developing health 
      care NLP tools. To realize the potential of community-based NLP (CBNLP), research 
      and development teams must thoughtfully consider mechanisms and resources needed 
      to effectively collaborate with community members for maximal societal and 
      ethical impact of NLP-based tools.

TI  - Identifying incarceration status in the electronic health record using large 
      language models in emergency department settings.
PG  - e53
LID - 10.1017/cts.2024.496 [doi]
LID - e53
AB  - BACKGROUND: Incarceration is a significant social determinant of health, 
      contributing to high morbidity, mortality, and racialized health inequities. 
      However, incarceration status is largely invisible to health services research 
      due to inadequate clinical electronic health record (EHR) capture. This study 
      aims to develop, train, and validate natural language processing (NLP) techniques 
      to more effectively identify incarceration status in the EHR. METHODS: The study 
      population consisted of adult patients (â¥ 18 y.o.) who presented to the emergency 
      department between June 2013 and August 2021. The EHR database was filtered for 
      notes for specific incarceration-related terms, and then a random selection of 
      1,000 notes was annotated for incarceration and further stratified into specific 
      statuses of prior history, recent, and current incarceration. For NLP model 
      development, 80% of the notes were used to train the Longformer-based and RoBERTa 
      algorithms. The remaining 20% of the notes underwent analysis with GPT-4. 
      RESULTS: There were 849 unique patients across 989 visits in the 1000 annotated 
      notes. Manual annotation revealed that 559 of 1000 notes (55.9%) contained 
      evidence of incarceration history. ICD-10 code (sensitivity: 4.8%, specificity: 
      99.1%, F1-score: 0.09) demonstrated inferior performance to RoBERTa NLP 
      (sensitivity: 78.6%, specificity: 73.3%, F1-score: 0.79), Longformer NLP 
      (sensitivity: 94.6%, specificity: 87.5%, F1-score: 0.93), and GPT-4 (sensitivity: 
      100%, specificity: 61.1%, F1-score: 0.86). CONCLUSIONS: Our advanced NLP models 
      demonstrate a high degree of accuracy in identifying incarceration status from 
      clinical notes. Further research is needed to explore their scaled implementation 
      in population health initiatives and assess their potential to mitigate health 
      disparities through tailored system interventions.

TI  - Ethical Considerations of Artificial Intelligence in Health Care: Examining the 
      Role of Generative Pretrained Transformer-4.
PG  - 205-210
LID - 10.5435/JAAOS-D-23-00787 [doi]
AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence technologies, such as large language 
      models (LLMs), in health care holds potential for improved efficiency and 
      decision support. However, ethical concerns must be addressed before widespread 
      adoption. This article focuses on the ethical principles surrounding the use of 
      Generative Pretrained Transformer-4 and its conversational model, ChatGPT, in 
      healthcare settings. One concern is potential inaccuracies in generated content. 
      LLMs can produce believable yet incorrect information, risking errors in medical 
      records. Opacity of training data exacerbates this, hindering accuracy 
      assessment. To mitigate, LLMs should train on precise, validated medical data 
      sets. Model bias is another critical concern because LLMs may perpetuate biases 
      from their training, leading to medically inaccurate and discriminatory 
      responses. Sampling, programming, and compliance biases contribute necessitating 
      careful consideration to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes. Privacy is 
      paramount in health care, using public LLMs raises risks. Strict data-sharing 
      agreements and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
      (HIPAA)-compliant training protocols are necessary to protect patient privacy. 
      Although artificial intelligence technologies offer promising opportunities in 
      health care, careful consideration of ethical principles is crucial. Addressing 
      concerns of inaccuracy, bias, and privacy will ensure responsible and 
      patient-centered implementation, benefiting both healthcare professionals and 
      patients.

PG  - 3197-3200
LID - 10.1007/s11845-023-03377-8 [doi]
AB  - GPT-4 is the latest version of ChatGPT which is reported by OpenAI to have 
      greater problem-solving abilities and an even broader knowledge base. We examined 
      GPT-4's ability to inform us about the latest literature in a given area, and to 
      write a discharge summary for a patient following an uncomplicated surgery and 
      its latest image analysis feature which was reported to be able to identify 
      objects in photos. All things considered, GPT-4 has the potential to help drive 
      medical innovation, from aiding with patient discharge notes, summarizing recent 
      clinical trials, providing information on ethical guidelines, and much more.

TI  - Scientific novelty beyond the experiment.
PG  - 1131-1173
LID - 10.1111/1751-7915.14222 [doi]
AB  - Practical experiments drive important scientific discoveries in biology, but 
      theory-based research studies also contribute novel-sometimes 
      paradigm-changing-findings. Here, we appraise the roles of theory-based 
      approaches focusing on the experiment-dominated wet-biology research areas of 
      microbial growth and survival, cell physiology, host-pathogen interactions, and 
      competitive or symbiotic interactions. Additional examples relate to analyses of 
      genome-sequence data, climate change and planetary health, habitability, and 
      astrobiology. We assess the importance of thought at each step of the research 
      process; the roles of natural philosophy, and inconsistencies in logic and 
      language, as drivers of scientific progress; the value of thought experiments; 
      the use and limitations of artificial intelligence technologies, including their 
      potential for interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research; and other 
      instances when theory is the most-direct and most-scientifically robust route to 
      scientific novelty including the development of techniques for practical 
      experimentation or fieldwork. We highlight the intrinsic need for human 
      engagement in scientific innovation, an issue pertinent to the ongoing 
      controversy over papers authored using/authored by artificial intelligence (such 
      as the large language model/chatbot ChatGPT). Other issues discussed are the way 
      in which aspects of language can bias thinking towards the spatial rather than 
      the temporal (and how this biased thinking can lead to skewed scientific 
      terminology); receptivity to research that is non-mainstream; and the importance 
      of theory-based science in education and epistemology. Whereas we briefly 
      highlight classic works (those by Oakes Ames, Francis H.C. Crick and James D. 
      Watson, Charles R. Darwin, Albert Einstein, James E. Lovelock, Lynn Margulis, 
      Gilbert Ryle, Erwin R.J.A. SchrÃ¶dinger, Alan M. Turing, and others), the focus is 
      on microbiology studies that are more-recent, discussing these in the context of 
      the scientific process and the types of scientific novelty that they represent. 
      These include several studies carried out during the 2020 to 2022 lockdowns of 
      the COVID-19 pandemic when access to research laboratories was disallowed (or 
      limited). We interviewed the authors of some of the featured microbiology-related 
      papers and-although we ourselves are involved in laboratory experiments and 
      practical fieldwork-also drew from our own research experiences showing that such 
      studies can not only produce new scientific findings but can also transcend 
      barriers between disciplines, act counter to scientific reductionism, integrate 
      biological data across different timescales and levels of complexity, and 
      circumvent constraints imposed by practical techniques. In relation to urgent 
      research needs, we believe that climate change and other global challenges may 
      require approaches beyond the experiment.

TI  - Accuracy of Information given by ChatGPT for patients with Inflammatory Bowel 
      Disease in relation to ECCO Guidelines.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: As acceptance of AI platforms increases, more patients will 
      consider these tools as sources of information. The ChatGPT architecture utilizes 
      a neural network to process natural language, thus generating responses based on 
      the context of input text. The accuracy and completeness of ChatGPT3.5 in the 
      context of Inflammatory Bowel Disease remains unclear. METHODS: In this 
      prospective study, 38 questions worded by IBD patients were inputted into 
      ChatGPT3.5. The following topics were covered: 1) CD, UC and malignancy, 2) 
      maternal medicine 3) infection and vaccination 4) complementary medicine. 
      Responses given by Chat GPT were assessed for accuracy (1 - completely incorrect 
      to 5 - completely correct) and completeness (3-point Likert scale; range 1 - 
      incomplete to 3 - complete) by 14 expert gastroenterologists, in comparison with 
      relevant ECCO guidelines. RESULTS: In terms of accuracy, most replies (84.2%) had 
      a median score of â¥4 (IQR:2) and a mean score of 3.87 (SD: +/- 0.6). For 
      completeness, 34.2% of the replies had a median score of 3 and 55.3 % had a 
      median score of between 2 and &lt;3. Overall, the mean rating was 2.24 (SD: +/- 0.4, 
      Median:2 IQR :1). Though group 3 and 4 had a higher mean for both accuracy and 
      completeness, there was no significant scoring variation between the 4 question 
      groups (Kruskal-Wallis test p:&gt;0.05). However, statistical analysis for the 
      different individual questions revealed a significant difference both for 
      accuracy (p&lt;0.001) and completeness (p&lt;0.001). The questions which rated the 
      highest for both accuracy and completeness were related to smoking, while the 
      lowest rating was related to screening for malignancy and vaccinations especially 
      in the context of immunosuppression and family planning. CONCLUSION: This is the 
      first study to demonstrate the capability of an AI-based system to provide 
      accurate and comprehensive answers to real-world patient queries in IBD. AI 
      systems may serve as a useful adjunct for patients, in addition to standard of 
      care in clinic and validated patient information resources. However, responses in 
      specialist areas may deviate from evidence-based guidance and the replies need to 
      give more firm advice.

AB  - Social determinants of health (SDoH) play a critical role in patient outcomes, 
      yet their documentation is often missing or incomplete in the structured data of 
      electronic health records (EHRs). Large language models (LLMs) could enable 
      high-throughput extraction of SDoH from the EHR to support research and clinical 
      care. However, class imbalance and data limitations present challenges for this 
      sparsely documented yet critical information. Here, we investigated the optimal 
      methods for using LLMs to extract six SDoH categories from narrative text in the 
      EHR: employment, housing, transportation, parental status, relationship, and 
      social support. The best-performing models were fine-tuned Flan-T5 XL for any 
      SDoH mentions (macro-F1 0.71), and Flan-T5 XXL for adverse SDoH mentions 
      (macro-F1 0.70). Adding LLM-generated synthetic data to training varied across 
      models and architecture, but improved the performance of smaller Flan-T5 models 
      (delta F1â+â0.12 to +0.23). Our best-fine-tuned models outperformed zero- and 
      few-shot performance of ChatGPT-family models in the zero- and few-shot setting, 
      except GPT4 with 10-shot prompting for adverse SDoH. Fine-tuned models were less 
      likely than ChatGPT to change their prediction when race/ethnicity and gender 
      descriptors were added to the text, suggesting less algorithmic bias (pâ&lt;â0.05). 
      Our models identified 93.8% of patients with adverse SDoH, while ICD-10 codes 
      captured 2.0%. These results demonstrate the potential of LLMs in improving 
      real-world evidence on SDoH and assisting in identifying patients who could 
      benefit from resource support.

LID - e002602
AB  - The recent release of highly advanced generative artificial intelligence (AI) 
      chatbots, including ChatGPT and Bard, which are powered by large language models 
      (LLMs), has attracted growing mainstream interest over its diverse applications 
      in clinical practice, including in health and healthcare. The potential 
      applications of LLM-based programmes in the medical field range from assisting 
      medical practitioners in improving their clinical decision-making and 
      streamlining administrative paperwork to empowering patients to take charge of 
      their own health. However, despite the broad range of benefits, the use of such 
      AI tools also comes with several limitations and ethical concerns that warrant 
      further consideration, encompassing issues related to privacy, data bias, and the 
      accuracy and reliability of information generated by AI. The focus of prior 
      research has primarily centred on the broad applications of LLMs in medicine. To 
      the author's knowledge, this is, the first article that consolidates current and 
      pertinent literature on LLMs to examine its potential in primary care. The 
      objectives of this paper are not only to summarise the potential benefits, risks 
      and challenges of using LLMs in primary care, but also to offer insights into 
      considerations that primary care clinicians should take into account when 
      deciding to adopt and integrate such technologies into their clinical practice.

AB  - The article examines the risks to social perception of health professions in the 
      context of the growing popularity of generative textual and visual neural 
      networks. The article is consistent with the growing body of research that tends 
      to see more risks of this technology, including for healthcare. The second focus 
      of the article - the stereotypes about health professions - is critical, as they 
      have been associated with negative outcomes for the healthcare system. The study 
      primarily focuses on the perception of nursing professionals as most stereotyped 
      by the public. Using uploads from the chatGPT, Kandinsky, and Shedevrum networks, 
      the author has investigated the neural network's embedded perceptions of the 
      nursing profession. Reproduction of certain stereotypes has been identified in 
      all neural networks; the appearance stereotypes (gender, age, race, uniform) are 
      more often shared by visual neural networks, while the function stereotypes (lack 
      of autonomy, dependence on colleagues) - by text networks. Actually, we can 
      assume the risks of a vicious circle, when the network is trained on the largely 
      stereotypical data, and products based on its output increase the scale of 
      stereotypical representations during subsequent training of the neural network. 
      Developers' efforts to avoid reproducing stereotypes are acknowledged, however, 
      the uploads show that they are not fully successful. To prevent the spread of 
      perceptual distortions in neural networks, it is recommended to promote their

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI), notably Generative Adversarial Networks, has the 
      potential to transform medical and patient education. Leveraging GANs in medical 
      fields, especially cosmetic surgery, provides a plethora of benefits, including 
      upholding patient confidentiality, ensuring broad exposure to diverse patient 
      scenarios, and democratizing medical education. This study investigated the 
      capacity of AI models, DALL-E 2, Midjourney, and Blue Willow, to generate 
      realistic images pertinent to cosmetic surgery. We combined the generative powers 
      of ChatGPT-4 and Google's BARD with these GANs to produce images of various 
      noses, faces, and eyelids. Four board-certified plastic surgeons evaluated the 
      generated images, eliminating the need for real patient photographs. Notably, 
      generated images predominantly showcased female faces with lighter skin tones, 
      lacking representation of males, older women, and those with a body mass index 
      above 20. The integration of AI in cosmetic surgery offers enhanced patient 
      education and training but demands careful and ethical incorporation to ensure 
      comprehensive representation and uphold medical standards.

TI  - Generative Language Models and Open Notes: Exploring the Promise and Limitations.
PG  - e51183

LID - e51183
AB  - Patients' online record access (ORA) is growing worldwide. In some countries, 
      including the United States and Sweden, access is advanced with patients 
      obtaining rapid access to their full records on the web including laboratory and 
      test results, lists of prescribed medications, vaccinations, and even the very 
      narrative reports written by clinicians (the latter, commonly referred to as 
      "open notes"). In the United States, patient's ORA is also available in a 
      downloadable form for use with other apps. While survey studies have shown that 
      some patients report many benefits from ORA, there remain challenges with 
      implementation around writing clinical documentation that patients may now read. 
      With ORA, the functionality of the record is evolving; it is no longer only an 
      aide memoire for doctors but also a communication tool for patients. Studies 
      suggest that clinicians are changing how they write documentation, inviting 
      worries about accuracy and completeness. Other concerns include work burdens; 
      while few objective studies have examined the impact of ORA on workload, some 
      research suggests that clinicians are spending more time writing notes and 
      answering queries related to patients' records. Aimed at addressing some of these 
      concerns, clinician and patient education strategies have been proposed. In this 
      viewpoint paper, we explore these approaches and suggest another longer-term 
      strategy: the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) to support 
      clinicians in documenting narrative summaries that patients will find easier to 
      understand. Applied to narrative clinical documentation, we suggest that such 
      approaches may significantly help preserve the accuracy of notes, strengthen 
      writing clarity and signals of empathy and patient-centered care, and serve as a 
      buffer against documentation work burdens. However, we also consider the current 
      risks associated with existing generative AI. We emphasize that for this 
      innovation to play a key role in ORA, the cocreation of clinical notes will be 
      imperative. We also caution that clinicians will need to be supported in how to 
      work alongside generative AI to optimize its considerable potential.

AB  - Artificial intelligence has advanced significantly in recent years, affecting 
      multiple aspects of life. In particular, this has had an impact on the machine 
      translation of texts, reducing or removing human interaction. Artificial 
      intelligence (AI)-based translation software models have thus become widely 
      available, and these now include Google Translate, Bing, Microsoft Translator, 
      DeepL, Reverso, Systran Translate, and Amazon Translate. Several computer-aided 
      translation (CAT) tools such as Memoq, Trados, Smartcat, Lokalise, Smartling, 
      Crowdin, TextUnited, and Memsource are also available. More recently, artificial 
      intelligence has been applied in the development of applications such as ChatGPT, 
      ChatSonic, GPT-3 Playground, Chat GPT 4 and YouChat, which simulate 
      conversational responses to researchers' inquiries, mimicking human interactions 
      more directly. This study thus aimed to examine any remaining contrasts between 
      human and AI translation in the legal field to investigate the potential 
      hypothesis that there is now no difference between human and AI translation. The 
      paper thus also examined concerns about whether the need for human translators 
      will decline in the face of AI development, as well as beginning to assess 
      whether it will ever be possible for those in the legal field to depend only on 
      machine translation. To achieve this, a collection of legal texts from various 
      contracts was chosen, and these pieces were both allocated to legal translators 
      and subjected to AI translation systems. Using a contrastive methodology, the 
      study thus examined the differences between AI and human translation, examining 
      the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches and discussing the situations in 
      which each approach might be most effective.

AB  - Artificial intelligence models play a crucial role in monitoring and maintaining 
      railroad infrastructure by analyzing image data of foreign objects on power 
      transmission lines. However, the availability of publicly accessible datasets for 
      railroad foreign objects is limited, and the rarity of anomalies in railroad 
      image data, combined with restricted data sharing, poses challenges for training 
      effective foreign object detection models. In this paper, the aim is to present a 
      new dataset of foreign objects on railroad transmission lines, and evaluating the 
      overall performance of mainstream detection models in this context. Taking a 
      unique approach and leveraging large-scale models such as ChatGPT (Chat 
      Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and text-to-image generation models, we 
      synthesize a series of foreign object data. The dataset includes 14,615 images 
      with 40,541 annotated objects, covering four common foreign objects on railroad 
      power transmission lines. Through empirical research on this dataset, we validate 
      the performance of various baseline models in foreign object detection, providing 
      valuable insights for the monitoring and maintenance of railroad facilities.

      and capabilities, with profound implications for their applications in 
      healthcare. These models, rooted in the Generative Pretrained Transformer 
      architecture, exhibit advanced natural language understanding and generation 
      skills. Within surgical oncology, LLMs, when integrated into a Generalist Medical 
      AI (GMAI) framework, hold great promise in offering real-time support throughout 
      the cancer journey. However, alongside these opportunities, this paper 
      underscores the importance of ethical, privacy, and efficacy considerations, 
      especially in light of issues like data drift and potential biases. Collaborative 
      efforts among healthcare providers, AI developers, and regulatory bodies are 
      pivotal in ensuring responsible and effective use of LLMs in surgical oncology, 
      thereby contributing to enhanced patient care and safety. As LLMs continue to 
      advance, they are poised to become indispensable tools in the delivery of 
      high-quality, efficient care in this specialized medical field.

AB  - AIMS: This study aimed to assess the potential of using an artificial 
      intelligence (AI) large language model to improve the readability of burns first 
      aid information. METHODS: An AI language model (ChatGPT-3) was used to rewrite 
      content from the top 50 English-language webpages containing burns first aid 
      information to be understandable by an individual with the literacy level of an 
      11-year-old, as recommended by the American Medical Association and Health 
      Education England. The assessment of readability was conducted using five 
      validated tools. RESULTS: In their original form, only 4% of the patient 
      education materials (PEMs) met the target readability level across all tools. The 
      median grade was 6.9 (SD=1.1). One-sample one-tailed t-test revealed that this 
      was not significantly below the target (p&nbsp;=&nbsp;.31). After AI-modification, 18% of 
      PEMs reached the target level using all tools, with a median grade of 6 (SD=0.9), 
      which was significantly below the target level (p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;.001). Once rewritten using 
      AI, paired t-test demonstrated that all readability scores improved significantly 
      (p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;.001). CONCLUSION: Utilising an AI language model proved an effective and 
      viable method for enhancing readability of burns first aid information.

LID - 10.1016/j.ajic.2024.02.007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health care-associated infection (HAI) surveillance is vital for 
      safety in health care settings. It helps identify infection risk factors, 
      enhancing patient safety and quality improvement. However, HAI surveillance is 
      complex, demanding specialized knowledge and resources. This study investigates 
      the use of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative large language 
      models, to improve HAI surveillance. METHODS: We assessed 2 AI agents, OpenAI's 
      chatGPT plus (GPT-4) and a Mixtral 8Ã7b-based local model, for their ability to 
      identify Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection (CLABSI) and 
      Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI) from 6 National Health Care 
      Safety Network training scenarios. The complexity of these scenarios was 
      analyzed, and responses were matched against expert opinions. RESULTS: Both AI 
      models accurately identified CLABSI and CAUTI in all scenarios when given clear 
      prompts. Challenges appeared with ambiguous prompts including Arabic numeral 
      dates, abbreviations, and special characters, causing occasional inaccuracies in 
      repeated tests. DISCUSSION: The study demonstrates AI's potential in accurately 
      identifying HAIs like CLABSI and CAUTI. Clear, specific prompts are crucial for 
      reliable AI responses, highlighting the need for human oversight in AI-assisted 
      HAI surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: AI shows promise in enhancing HAI surveillance, 
      potentially streamlining tasks, and freeing health care staff for patient-focused 
      activities. Effective AI use requires user education and ongoing AI model 
      refinement.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous research applying large language models (LLMs) to medicine 
      was focused on text-based information. Recently, multimodal variants of LLMs 
      acquired the capability of recognizing images. OBJECTIVE: We aim to evaluate the 
      image recognition capability of generative pretrained transformer (GPT)-4V, a 
      recent multimodal LLM developed by OpenAI, in the medical field by testing how 
      visual information affects its performance to answer questions in the 117th 
      Japanese National Medical Licensing Examination. METHODS: We focused on 108 
      questions that had 1 or more images as part of a question and presented GPT-4V 
      with the same questions under two conditions: (1) with both the question text and 
      associated images and (2) with the question text only. We then compared the 
      difference in accuracy between the 2 conditions using the exact McNemar test. 
      RESULTS: Among the 108 questions with images, GPT-4V's accuracy was 68% (73/108) 
      when presented with images and 72% (78/108) when presented without images 
      (P=.36). For the 2 question categories, clinical and general, the accuracies with 
      and those without images were 71% (70/98) versus 78% (76/98; P=.21) and 30% 
      (3/10) versus 20% (2/10; Pâ¥.99), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The additional 
      information from the images did not significantly improve the performance of 
      GPT-4V in the Japanese National Medical Licensing Examination.

TI  - Cracking the Code: The Role of Peripheral Nervous System Signaling in Fracture 
      Repair.
PG  - 193-204
LID - 10.1007/s11914-023-00846-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The traditionally understated role of neural regulation in 
      fracture healing is gaining prominence, as recent findings underscore the 
      peripheral nervous system's critical contribution to bone repair. Indeed, it is 
      becoming more evident that the nervous system modulates every stage of fracture 
      healing, from the onset of inflammation to repair and eventual remodeling. RECENT 
      FINDINGS: Essential to this process are neurotrophins and neuropeptides, such as 
      substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and neuropeptide Y. These molecules 
      fulfill key roles in promoting osteogenesis, influencing inflammation, and 
      mediating pain. The sympathetic nervous system also plays an important role in 
      the healing process: while local sympathectomies may improve fracture healing, 
      systemic sympathetic denervation impairs fracture healing. Furthermore, chronic 
      activation of the sympathetic nervous system, often triggered by stress, is a 
      potential impediment to effective fracture healing, marking an important area for 
      further investigation. The potential to manipulate aspects of the nervous system 
      offers promising therapeutic possibilities for improving outcomes in fracture 
      healing. This review article is part of a series of multiple manuscripts designed 
      to determine the utility of using artificial intelligence for writing scientific 
      reviews.

AB  - Background Cardiovascular responses to exercise are essential indicators of 
      cardiovascular health and fitness. Understanding how different types of exercise, 
      such as lower-body and whole-body exercises, impact these responses is crucial 
      for designing effective fitness programs and assessing cardiovascular function. 
      Aim This study aimed to compare the cardiovascular response of young adults 
      during lower-body exercise using a bicycle ergometer and whole-body exercise on a 
      treadmill. Methods Thirty-two healthy young adults participated in this study. 
      Each participant completed two exercise sessions on separate days: lower-body 
      exercise on a bicycle ergometer with a fixed cadence of 60 rpm with a breaking 
      resistance of 1.75 kg and whole-body exercise on a treadmill with a speed of 1.7 
      mph and a 10% grade. Heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (BP), and diastolic 
      BP were measured at rest and immediately after a three-minute exercise. Data were 
      analyzed using paired t-tests to compare the cardiovascular responses between the 
      two exercise modalities. Results A total of 17 male and 15 female young adults 
      with a mean age of 20.87Â±1.43 years participated in the study. The male and 
      female participants had similar ages (p =0.56) and body mass indexes (p = 0.1). 
      There was a higher HR (129.16Â±2.67 versus 150.87Â±3.23, p&lt;0.0001) and systolic BP 
      (127.29Â±2.34 versus 144.9Â±4.16, p&lt;0.0001) and lower diastolic BP (68.97Â±2.41 
      versus 62.97Â±2.31, p&lt;0.0001) in whole body exercise on treadmill compared to 
      lower body exercise in bicycle ergometer. The effect size was large enough as 
      Cohen's d was 7.33, 5.13, and 2.54 for HR, systolic BP, and diastolic BP, 
      respectively. Conclusion In sedentary young adults, treadmill exercise led to 
      higher HR, systolic BP, and lower diastolic BP than bicycle ergometer exercise. 
      Increased muscle recruitment might result in higher energy expenditure, 
      increasing the HR and systolic BP to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the working 
      muscles. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms and long-term 
      implications for precise exercise recommendations and better cardiovascular 
      health management.

TI  - Using artificial intelligence for exercise prescription in personalised health 
      promotion: A critical evaluation of OpenAI's GPT-4 model.
PG  - 221-241
LID - 10.5114/biolsport.2024.133661 [doi]
AB  - The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in healthcare provides new 
      possibilities for personalized health management. AI-based fitness applications 
      are becoming more common, facilitating the opportunity for individualised 
      exercise prescription. However, the use of AI carries the risk of inadequate 
      expert supervision, and the efficacy and validity of such applications have not 
      been thoroughly investigated, particularly in the context of diverse health 
      conditions. The aim of the study was to critically assess the efficacy of 
      exercise prescriptions generated by OpenAI's Generative Pre-Trained Transformer 4 
      (GPT-4) model for five example patient profiles with diverse health conditions 
      and fitness goals. Our focus was to assess the model's ability to generate 
      exercise prescriptions based on a singular, initial interaction, akin to a 
      typical user experience. The evaluation was conducted by leading experts in the 
      field of exercise prescription. Five distinct scenarios were formulated, each 
      representing a hypothetical individual with a specific health condition and 
      fitness objective. Upon receiving details of each individual, the GPT-4 model was 
      tasked with generating a 30-day exercise program. These AI-derived exercise 
      programs were subsequently subjected to a thorough evaluation by experts in 
      exercise prescription. The evaluation encompassed adherence to established 
      principles of frequency, intensity, time, and exercise type; integration of 
      perceived exertion levels; consideration for medication intake and the respective 
      medical condition; and the extent of program individualization tailored to each 
      hypothetical profile. The AI model could create general safety-conscious exercise 
      programs for various scenarios. However, the AI-generated exercise prescriptions 
      lacked precision in addressing individual health conditions and goals, often 
      prioritizing excessive safety over the effectiveness of training. The AI-based 
      approach aimed to ensure patient improvement through gradual increases in 
      training load and intensity, but the model's potential to fine-tune its 
      recommendations through ongoing interaction was not fully satisfying. AI 
      technologies, in their current state, can serve as supplemental tools in exercise 
      prescription, particularly in enhancing accessibility for individuals unable to 
      access, often costly, professional advice. However, AI technologies are not yet 
      recommended as a substitute for personalized, progressive, and health 
      condition-specific prescriptions provided by healthcare and fitness 
      professionals. Further research is needed to explore more interactive use of AI 
      models and integration of real-time physiological feedback.

AB  - Virtual Mental Health Assistants (VMHAs) continuously evolve to support the 
      overloaded global healthcare system, which receives approximately 60 million 
      primary care visits and 6 million emergency room visits annually. These systems, 
      developed by clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, and AI researchers, are 
      designed to aid in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). The main focus of VMHAs is 
      to provide relevant information to mental health professionals (MHPs) and engage 
      in meaningful conversations to support individuals with mental health conditions. 
      However, certain gaps prevent VMHAs from fully delivering on their promise during 
      active communications. One of the gaps is their inability to explain their 
      decisions to patients and MHPs, making conversations less trustworthy. 
      Additionally, VMHAs can be vulnerable in providing unsafe responses to patient 
      queries, further undermining their reliability. In this review, we assess the 
      current state of VMHAs on the grounds of user-level explainability and safety, a 
      set of desired properties for the broader adoption of VMHAs. This includes the 
      examination of ChatGPT, a conversation agent developed on AI-driven models: 
      GPT3.5 and GPT-4, that has been proposed for use in providing mental health 
      services. By harnessing the collaborative and impactful contributions of AI, 
      natural language processing, and the mental health professionals (MHPs) 
      community, the review identifies opportunities for technological progress in 
      VMHAs to ensure their capabilities include explainable and safe behaviors. It 
      also emphasizes the importance of measures to guarantee that these advancements 
      align with the promise of fostering trustworthy conversations.

TI  - Performance of a large language model on Japanese emergency medicine board 
      certification examinations.
LID - 10.1272/jnms.JNMS.2024_91-205 [doi]
AB  - Background Emergency physicians need a broad range of knowledge and skills to 
      address critical medical, traumatic, and environmental conditions. Artificial 
      intelligence (AI), including large language models (LLMs), has potential 
      applications in healthcare settings; however, the performance of LLMs in 
      emergency medicine remains unclear.Methods To evaluate the reliability of 
      information provided by ChatGPT, an LLM was given the questions set by the 
      Japanese Association of Acute Medicine in its board certification examinations 
      over a period of 5 years (2018-2022) and programmed to answer them twice. 
      Statistical analysis was used to assess agreement of the two responses.Results 
      The LLM successfully answered 465 of the 475 text-based questions, achieving an 
      overall correct response rate of 62.3%. For questions without images, the rate of 
      correct answers was 65.9%. For questions with images that were not explained to 
      the LLM, the rate of correct answers was only 52.0%. The annual rates of correct 
      answers to questions without images ranged from 56.3% to 78.8%. Accuracy was 
      better for scenario-based questions (69.1%) than for stand-alone questions 
      (62.1%). Agreement between the two responses was substantial (kappa = 0.70). 
      Factual error accounted for 82% of the incorrectly answered questions.Conclusion 
      An LLM performed satisfactorily on an emergency medicine board certification 
      examination in Japanese and without images. However, factual errors in the 
      responses highlight the need for physician oversight when using LLMs.

TI  - Leveraging Generative AI and Large Language Models: A Comprehensive Roadmap for 
      Healthcare Integration.
LID - 10.3390/healthcare11202776 [doi]
LID - 2776
AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs), 
      exemplified by ChatGPT, are promising for revolutionizing data and information 
      management in healthcare and medicine. However, there is scant literature guiding 
      their integration for non-AI professionals. This study conducts a scoping 
      literature review to address the critical need for guidance on integrating 
      generative AI and LLMs into healthcare and medical practices. It elucidates the 
      distinct mechanisms underpinning these technologies, such as Reinforcement 
      Learning from Human Feedback (RLFH), including few-shot learning and 
      chain-of-thought reasoning, which differentiates them from traditional, 
      rule-based AI systems. It requires an inclusive, collaborative co-design process 
      that engages all pertinent stakeholders, including clinicians and consumers, to 
      achieve these benefits. Although global research is examining both opportunities 
      and challenges, including ethical and legal dimensions, LLMs offer promising 
      advancements in healthcare by enhancing data management, information retrieval, 
      and decision-making processes. Continued innovation in data acquisition, model 
      fine-tuning, prompt strategy development, evaluation, and system implementation 
      is imperative for realizing the full potential of these technologies. 
      Organizations should proactively engage with these technologies to improve 
      healthcare quality, safety, and efficiency, adhering to ethical and legal 
      guidelines for responsible application.

TI  - GPT Technology to Help Address Longstanding Barriers to Care in Free Medical 
      Clinics.
PG  - 1906-1909
LID - 10.1007/s10439-023-03256-4 [doi]
AB  - The implementation of technology in healthcare has revolutionized 
      patient-centered decision making by providing contextualized information about a 
      patient's healthcare journey, leading to increased efficiency (Keyworth et al. in 
      BMC Med Inform Decis Mak 18:93, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-018-0661-3 
      ). Artificial intelligence has been integrated within Electronic Health Records 
      (EHR) to prompt screenings or diagnostic tests based on a patient's holistic 
      health profile. While larger hospitals have already widely adopted these 
      technologies, free clinics hold lower utilization of these advanced capability 
      EHRs. The patient population at a free clinic faces a multitude of factors that 
      limits their access to comprehensive care, thus requiring necessary efforts and 
      measures to close the gap in healthcare disparities. Emerging Artificial 
      Intelligence (AI) technology, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, GPT-4, and other large 
      language models (LLMs) have remarkable potential to improve patient care 
      outcomes, promote health equity, and enhance comprehensive and holistic care in 
      resource-limited settings. This paper aims to identify areas in which integrating 
      these LLM AI advancements into free clinics operations can optimize and 
      streamline healthcare delivery to underserved patient populations. This paper 
      also identifies areas of improvements in GPT that are necessary to deliver those 
      services.

      Practice and Scholarship.
LID - 10.1097/ACM.0000000000005636 [doi]
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) methods, especially machine learning and natural 
      language processing, are increasingly affecting health professions education 
      (HPE), including the medical school application and selection processes, 
      assessment, and scholarship production. The rise of large language models over 
      the past 18 months, such as ChatGPT, has raised questions about how best to 
      incorporate these methods into HPE. The lack of training in AI among most HPE 
      faculty and scholars poses an important challenge in facilitating such 
      discussions. In this commentary, the authors provide a primer on the AI methods 
      most often used in the practice and scholarship of HPE, discuss the most pressing 
      challenges and opportunities these tools afford, and underscore that these 
      methods should be understood as part of the larger set of statistical tools 
      available.Despite their ability to process huge amounts of data and their high 
      performance completing some tasks, AI methods are only as good as the data on 
      which they are trained. Of particular importance is that these models can 
      perpetuate the biases that are present in those training datasets, and they can 
      be applied in a biased manner by human users. A minimum set of expectations for 
      the application of AI methods in HPE practice and scholarship are discussed in 
      this commentary, including the interpretability of the models developed and the 
      transparency needed into the use and characteristics of such methods.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This scoping review aimed to summarize the available literature on 
      the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in pharmacy education and identify gaps 
      where additional research is needed. FINDINGS: Seven studies specifically 
      addressing the use of AI in pharmacy education were identified. Of these 7 
      studies, 5 focused on AI use in the context of teaching and learning, 1 on the 
      prediction of academic performance for admissions, and the final study focused on 
      using AI text generation to elucidate the benefits and limitations of ChatGPT use 
      in pharmacy education. SUMMARY: There are currently a limited number of available 
      publications that describe AI use in pharmacy education. Several challenges exist 
      regarding the use of AI in pharmacy education, including the need for faculty 
      expertise and time, limited generalizability of tools, limited outcomes data, and 
      several legal and ethical concerns. As AI use increases and implementation 
      becomes more standardized, opportunities will be created for the inclusion of AI 
      in pharmacy education.

      Cognitive Factors.
PG  - 1139-1150
LID - 10.2147/PRBM.S460503 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Textual data analysis has become a popular method for examining 
      complex human behavior in various fields, including psychology, psychiatry, 
      sociology, computer science, data mining, forensic sciences, and communication 
      studies. However, identifying the most relevant textual parameters for analyzing 
      complex behavior is still a challenge. GOAL OF STUDY: This paper aims to explore 
      potential textual parameters that could be useful in analyzing behavior through 
      complex textual data. Furthermore, we have examined the randomly generated text 
      based on different textual parameters. METHODS: To achieve this goal, we 
      conducted a comprehensive review of the literature on textual data analysis and 
      identified several potential topics that could be relevant, such as sentiment 
      analysis, discourse analysis, lexical analysis, and syntactic analysis. We 
      discuss the theoretical background and practical implications of each parameter 
      and provide examples of how they have been used in previous research. 
      Furthermore, we highlight the importance of considering the context in which 
      these parameters are applied and the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to 
      gain a deeper understanding of complex behavior through textual data analysis. 
      Furthermore, we have provided Python code in the Supplementary Materials to 
      facilitate a comprehensive analysis of such behaviors. In addition, to generate 
      the text for analysis, we utilized ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo by requesting it to generate 
      a random text of 1000 words divided into five paragraphs. Afterwards, we applied 
      the provided Python code to analyze the randomly generated text. CONCLUSION: 
      Overall, this paper provides a foundation for researchers to identify relevant 
      textual parameters to analyze complex human behavior in their respective fields 
      such as linguistics, sociology, psychiatry, and psychology.

AB  - It is likely that individuals are turning to Large Language Models (LLMs) to seek 
      health advice, much like searching for diagnoses on Google. We evaluate clinical 
      accuracy of GPT-3Â·5 and GPT-4 for suggesting initial diagnosis, examination steps 
      and treatment of 110 medical cases across diverse clinical disciplines. Moreover, 
      two model configurations of the Llama 2 open source LLMs are assessed in a 
      sub-study. For benchmarking the diagnostic task, we conduct a naÃ¯ve Google search 
      for comparison. Overall, GPT-4 performed best with superior performances over 
      GPT-3Â·5 considering diagnosis and examination and superior performance over 
      Google for diagnosis. Except for treatment, better performance on frequent vs 
      rare diseases is evident for all three approaches. The sub-study indicates 
      slightly lower performances for Llama models. In conclusion, the commercial LLMs 
      show growing potential for medical question answering in two successive major 
      releases. However, some weaknesses underscore the need for robust and regulated 
      AI models in health care. Open source LLMs can be a viable option to address 
      specific needs regarding data privacy and transparency of training.

      Research and Clinical Practice.
LID - 10.1097/FJC.0000000000001546 [doi]
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to revolutionize how science, and 
      biomedical research in particular, are done. With AI, problem solving and complex 
      tasks using massive data sets can be performed at a much higher rate and 
      dimensionality level compared to humans. With the ability to handle huge data 
      sets and self-learn, AI is already being exploited in drug design, drug 
      repurposing, toxicology, and material identification. AI could also be used in 
      both basic and clinical research in study design, defining outcomes, analyzing 
      data, interpreting findings, and even identifying the most appropriate areas of 
      investigation and funding sources. State-of-the-art AI-based large language 
      models (LLM), such as ChatGPT and Perplexity, are positioned to change forever 
      how science is communicated and how scientists interact with one another and 
      their profession, including post-publication appraisal and critique. Like all 
      revolutions, upheaval will follow and not all outcomes can be predicted, 
      necessitating guardrails at the onset, especially to minimize the untoward impact 
      of the many drawbacks of LLMs, which include lack of confidentiality, risk of 
      hallucinations, and propagation of mainstream albeit potentially mistaken 
      opinions and perspectives. In this review, we highlight areas of biomedical 
      research that are already being reshaped by AI and how AI is likely to impact it 
      further in the near future. We discuss the potential benefits of AI in biomedical 
      research and address possible risks, some surrounding the creative process, that 
      warrant further reflection.

AB  - Transformer-based models, exemplified by GPT-3, ChatGPT, and GPT-4, have recently 
      garnered considerable attention in both academia and industry due to their 
      promising performance in general language tasks. Nevertheless, these models 
      typically involve computationally encoding processes, and in some cases, decoding 
      processes as well, both of which are fundamentally large-scale matrix 
      multiplication. These operations bring the inevitable challenges of massive 
      computation resources and huge memory footprint, usually requiring at least 
      10(23) FLOPs and hundreds of gigabytes, respectively. A common method to address 
      this issue is to reduce the computational and memory requirements by applying 
      layerwise quantization to the transformer, replacing the usual fp32 data type 
      with a low-bit equivalent. Unfortunately, this method often leads to decreased 
      model accuracy and necessitates time-consuming retraining. Such retraining not 
      only requires fine-tuning skills but also substantial computational resources, 
      posing challenges for users. To specifically tackle these issues, we propose BCT, 
      a framework of blockwise compression for transformers without retraining, aiming 
      to facilitate model deployment. Unlike layerwise compression methods, BCT 
      achieves finer compression of the entire transformer by operating blockwise. This 
      method mitigates data distribution deviation caused by quantization, eliminating 
      the requirement for retraining. BCT effectively compresses all components of the 
      model, including but not limited to the embedding, matrix multiplication, GELU, 
      Softmax, layer normalization, and intermediate results. In a case study, an 
      efficient model is compressed by BCT achieving up to 7.988x compression. 
      Subsequently, we also evaluate it on several General Language Understanding 
      Evaluation (GLUE) datasets. Experimental results on the majority of GLUE 
      benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, as BCT achieves less than 
      a 0.9% degradation in accuracy compared to the more than a 1% degradation seen 
      with other methods providing similar or inferior compression ratios.

TI  - Comparing Physician and Artificial Intelligence Chatbot Responses to Patient 
      Questions Posted to a Public Social Media Forum.
PG  - 589-596
LID - 10.1001/jamainternmed.2023.1838 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: The rapid expansion of virtual health care has caused a surge in 
      patient messages concomitant with more work and burnout among health care 
      professionals. Artificial intelligence (AI) assistants could potentially aid in 
      creating answers to patient questions by drafting responses that could be 
      reviewed by clinicians. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability of an AI chatbot 
      assistant (ChatGPT), released in November 2022, to provide quality and empathetic 
      responses to patient questions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this 
      cross-sectional study, a public and nonidentifiable database of questions from a 
      public social media forum (Reddit's r/AskDocs) was used to randomly draw 195 
      exchanges from October 2022 where a verified physician responded to a public 
      question. Chatbot responses were generated by entering the original question into 
      a fresh session (without prior questions having been asked in the session) on 
      December 22 and 23, 2022. The original question along with anonymized and 
      randomly ordered physician and chatbot responses were evaluated in triplicate by 
      a team of licensed health care professionals. Evaluators chose "which response 
      was better" and judged both "the quality of information provided" (very poor, 
      poor, acceptable, good, or very good) and "the empathy or bedside manner 
      provided" (not empathetic, slightly empathetic, moderately empathetic, 
      empathetic, and very empathetic). Mean outcomes were ordered on a 1 to 5 scale 
      and compared between chatbot and physicians. RESULTS: Of the 195 questions and 
      responses, evaluators preferred chatbot responses to physician responses in 78.6% 
      (95% CI, 75.0%-81.8%) of the 585 evaluations. Mean (IQR) physician responses were 
      significantly shorter than chatbot responses (52 [17-62] words vs 211 [168-245] 
      words; tâ=â25.4; Pâ&lt;â.001). Chatbot responses were rated of significantly higher 
      quality than physician responses (tâ=â13.3; Pâ&lt;â.001). The proportion of 
      responses rated as good or very good quality (â¥ 4), for instance, was higher for 
      chatbot than physicians (chatbot: 78.5%, 95% CI, 72.3%-84.1%; physicians: 22.1%, 
      95% CI, 16.4%-28.2%;). This amounted to 3.6 times higher prevalence of good or 
      very good quality responses for the chatbot. Chatbot responses were also rated 
      significantly more empathetic than physician responses (tâ=â18.9; Pâ&lt;â.001). The 
      proportion of responses rated empathetic or very empathetic (â¥4) was higher for 
      chatbot than for physicians (physicians: 4.6%, 95% CI, 2.1%-7.7%; chatbot: 45.1%, 
      95% CI, 38.5%-51.8%; physicians: 4.6%, 95% CI, 2.1%-7.7%). This amounted to 9.8 
      times higher prevalence of empathetic or very empathetic responses for the 
      chatbot. CONCLUSIONS: In this cross-sectional study, a chatbot generated quality 
      and empathetic responses to patient questions posed in an online forum. Further 
      exploration of this technology is warranted in clinical settings, such as using 
      chatbot to draft responses that physicians could then edit. Randomized trials 
      could assess further if using AI assistants might improve responses, lower 
      clinician burnout, and improve patient outcomes.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Clinical interpretation of complex biomarkers for precision oncology 
      currently requires manual investigations of previous studies and databases. 
      Conversational large language models (LLMs) might be beneficial as automated 
      tools for assisting clinical decision-making. OBJECTIVE: To assess performance 
      and define their role using 4 recent LLMs as support tools for precision 
      oncology. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This diagnostic study examined 10 
      fictional cases of patients with advanced cancer with genetic alterations. Each 
      case was submitted to 4 different LLMs (ChatGPT, Galactica, Perplexity, and 
      BioMedLM) and 1 expert physician to identify personalized treatment options in 
      2023. Treatment options were masked and presented to a molecular tumor board 
      (MTB), whose members rated the likelihood of a treatment option coming from an 
      LLM on a scale from 0 to 10 (0, extremely unlikely; 10, extremely likely) and 
      decided whether the treatment option was clinically useful. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: Number of treatment options, precision, recall, F1 score of LLMs 
      compared with human experts, recognizability, and usefulness of recommendations. 
      RESULTS: For 10 fictional cancer patients (4 with lung cancer, 6 with other; 
      median [IQR] 3.5 [3.0-4.8] molecular alterations per patient), a median (IQR) 
      number of 4.0 (4.0-4.0) compared with 3.0 (3.0-5.0), 7.5 (4.3-9.8), 11.5 
      (7.8-13.0), and 13.0 (11.3-21.5) treatment options each was identified by the 
      human expert and 4 LLMs, respectively. When considering the expert as a criterion 
      standard, LLM-proposed treatment options reached F1 scores of 0.04, 0.17, 0.14, 
      and 0.19 across all patients combined. Combining treatment options from different 
      LLMs allowed a precision of 0.29 and a recall of 0.29 for an F1 score of 0.29. 
      LLM-generated treatment options were recognized as AI-generated with a median 
      (IQR) 7.5 (5.3-9.0) points in contrast to 2.0 (1.0-3.0) points for manually 
      annotated cases. A crucial reason for identifying AI-generated treatment options 
      was insufficient accompanying evidence. For each patient, at least 1 LLM 
      generated a treatment option that was considered helpful by MTB members. Two 
      unique useful treatment options (including 1 unique treatment strategy) were 
      identified only by LLM. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this diagnostic study, 
      treatment options of LLMs in precision oncology did not reach the quality and 
      credibility of human experts; however, they generated helpful ideas that might 
      have complemented established procedures. Considering technological progress, 
      LLMs could play an increasingly important role in assisting with screening and 
      selecting relevant biomedical literature to support evidence-based, personalized 
      treatment decisions.

AB  - There are two main ways to discover or design small drug molecules. The first 
      involves fine-tuning existing molecules or commercially successful drugs through 
      quantitative structure-activity relationships and virtual screening. The second 
      approach involves generating new molecules through de novo drug design or inverse 
      quantitative structure-activity relationship. Both methods aim to get a drug 
      molecule with the best pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles. However, 
      bringing a new drug to market is an expensive and time-consuming endeavor, with 
      the average cost being estimated at around $2.5 billion. One of the biggest 
      challenges is screening the vast number of potential drug candidates to find one 
      that is both safe and effective. The development of artificial intelligence in 
      recent years has been phenomenal, ushering in a revolution in many fields. The 
      field of pharmaceutical sciences has also significantly benefited from multiple 
      applications of artificial intelligence, especially drug discovery projects. 
      Artificial intelligence models are finding use in molecular property prediction, 
      molecule generation, virtual screening, synthesis planning, repurposing, among 
      others. Lately, generative artificial intelligence has gained popularity across 
      domains for its ability to generate entirely new data, such as images, sentences, 
      audios, videos, novel chemical molecules, etc. Generative artificial intelligence 
      has also delivered promising results in drug discovery and development. This 
      review article delves into the fundamentals and framework of various generative 
      artificial intelligence models in the context of drug discovery via de novo drug 
      design approach. Various basic and advanced models have been discussed, along 
      with their recent applications. The review also explores recent examples and 
      advances in the generative artificial intelligence approach, as well as the 
      challenges and ongoing efforts to fully harness the potential of generative 
      artificial intelligence in generating novel drug molecules in a faster and more 
      affordable manner. Some clinical-level assets generated form generative 
      artificial intelligence have also been discussed in this review to show the 
      ever-increasing application of artificial intelligence in drug discovery through 
      commercial partnerships.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This comprehensive review delves into the intricate interplay 
      between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and osteoporosis, two prevalent conditions with 
      significant implications for individuals' quality of life. The purpose is to 
      explore their bidirectional association, underpinned by common pathological 
      processes such as aging, genetic factors, inflammation, and estrogen deficiency. 
      RECENT FINDINGS: Recent advances have shown promise in treating both Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD) and osteoporosis by targeting disease-specific proteins and bone 
      metabolism regulators. Monoclonal antibodies against beta-amyloid and tau for AD, 
      as well as RANKL and sclerostin for osteoporosis, have displayed therapeutic 
      potential. Additionally, ongoing research has identified neuroinflammatory genes 
      shared between AD and osteoporosis, offering insight into the interconnected 
      inflammatory mechanisms. This knowledge opens avenues for innovative dual-purpose 
      therapies that could address both conditions, potentially revolutionizing 
      treatment approaches for AD and osteoporosis simultaneously. This review 
      underscores the potential for groundbreaking advancements in early diagnosis and 
      treatment by unraveling the intricate connection between AD and bone health. It 
      advocates for a holistic, patient-centered approach to medical care that 
      considers both cognitive and bone health, ultimately aiming to enhance the 
      overall well-being of individuals affected by these conditions.&nbsp;This review 
      article is part of a series of multiple manuscripts designed to determine the 
      utility of using artificial intelligence for writing scientific reviews.

TI  - Validity and reliability of artificial intelligence chatbots as public sources of 
      information on endodontics.
PG  - 305-314
LID - 10.1111/iej.14014 [doi]
AB  - AIM: This study aimed to evaluate and compare the validity and reliability of 
      responses provided by GPT-3.5, Google Bard, and Bing to frequently asked 
      questions (FAQs) in the field of endodontics. METHODOLOGY: FAQs were formulated 
      by expert endodontists (nâ=â10) and collected through GPT-3.5 queries (nâ=â10), 
      with every question posed to each chatbot three times. Responses (Nâ=â180) were 
      independently evaluated by two board-certified endodontists using a modified 
      Global Quality Score (GQS) on a 5-point Likert scale (5: strongly agree; 4: 
      agree; 3: neutral; 2: disagree; 1: strongly disagree). Disagreements on scoring 
      were resolved through evidence-based discussions. The validity of responses was 
      analysed by categorizing scores into valid or invalid at two thresholds: The low 
      threshold was set at score â¥4 for all three responses whilst the high threshold 
      was set at score 5 for all three responses. Fisher's exact test was conducted to 
      compare the validity of responses between chatbots. Cronbach's alpha was 
      calculated to assess the reliability by assessing the consistency of repeated 
      responses for each chatbot. RESULTS: All three chatbots provided answers to all 
      questions. Using the low-threshold validity test (GPT-3.5: 95%; Google Bard: 85%; 
      Bing: 75%), there was no significant difference between the platforms (pâ&gt;â.05). 
      When using the high-threshold validity test, the chatbot scores were 
      substantially lower (GPT-3.5: 60%; Google Bard: 15%; Bing: 15%). The validity of 
      GPT-3.5 responses was significantly higher than Google Bard and Bing (pâ=â.008). 
      All three chatbots achieved an acceptable level of reliability (Cronbach's alpha 
      &gt;0.7). CONCLUSIONS: GPT-3.5 provided more credible information on topics related 
      to endodontics compared to Google Bard and Bing.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, including machine learning, deep 
      learning, natural language processing, generative AI, the metaverse and other 
      iterations, are rapidly changing the landscape of education. Related technologies 
      not only enhance the teaching and learning process but also improve the quality 
      and availability of educational content. AI facilitates educational 
      transformation, reshapes teaching models, and helps students achieve their 
      personalized learning needs, thus improving learning outcomes, learning 
      efficiencies, and teaching practices. Despite the many AI application cases in 
      nursing management and clinical practice, the application of AI in nursing 
      education remains in its infancy. Machine learning has been used to predict the 
      academic performance and graduation results of nursing students, thereby 
      facilitating the early identification of additional support needs. Natural 
      language processing technology has been used to develop chatbots and virtual 
      teachers to assist learning, providing personalized learning support to help 
      students overcome learning obstacles. Also, generative AI technologies such as 
      ChatGPT (chat generative pre-trained transformer) have been used to create 
      simulated patient cases and as a tool for grading academic writing automatically. 
      Moreover, the combination of generative AI technology and the metaverse has 
      introduced new possibilities to nursing education, allowing students to learn in 
      a more-immersive virtual environment. Despite the significant benefits brought by 
      AI to nursing education, its implementation and integration still face multiple 
      challenges, including high costs, the need to provide technical training to 
      teachers, and the need to address issues such as academic integrity and data 
      privacy. The authors hope this article will help promote interdisciplinary 
      cooperation between nursing educators and information and communication experts 
      and the development of AI-assisted teaching to open a new chapter in nursing 
      education.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of the current study is to evaluate the quality, 
      reliability, readability, and similarity of data provided by different AI-based 
      chatbots in the field of orthognathic surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Guidelines 
      on orthognathic surgery were reviewed, and a list of questions for patients to 
      ask chatbots was produced by two reasearchers. The questions were categorized 
      into 'General Information and Procedure' and 'Results and Recovery', with 30 
      questions in each category. Five different scoring criteria were used to evaluate 
      the chatbot responses to 60 questions: Ensuring Quality Information for Patients 
      (EQIP) tool, Reliability Scoring System (adapted from DISCERN), Global Quality 
      Scale (GQS), Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) and Similarity Index. RESULTS: 
      The highest mean values were observed in OpenEvidence for EQIP tool, SMOG, and 
      Similarity Index, while for Reliability and GQS assessment criteria, MediSearch 
      showed the highest values. When evaluated in terms of reliability and quality, 
      all three AI-based chatbots demonstrated high reliability and good quality; 
      however, they required at least a college-level education for readability based 
      on the SMOG index. Additionally, upon assessment of similarity, ChatGPT-4 
      displayed high originality, while OpenEvidence exhibited a high degree of 
      similarity. CONCLUSION: AI-based chatbots with a variety of features have usually 
      provided answers with high quality, reliability, and difficult readability to 
      questions. Although the medical information in the field of orthognathic surgery 
      provided through chatbots is of higher quality, it is recommended that 
      individuals consult their healthcare professionals on this issue.

TI  - Large language model may assist diagnosis of SAPHO syndrome by bone scintigraphy.
LID - road115 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/mr/road115 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this study, we employed a large language model to evaluate the 
      diagnostic efficacy of radiology reports of bone scintigraphy in the context of 
      identifying SAPHO syndrome, and further examined the potential of such a model to 
      augment the diagnostic procedure. METHODS: Imaging data and clinical information 
      of 151 patients (105/46 women/men, mean age: 53.5 years) who underwent bone 
      scintigraphy for suspected SAPHO syndrome between January 2007 and December 2022 
      were retrospectively reviewed. ChatGPT-4.0 was used as the large language model. 
      The diagnostic performance of the large language model was verified by comparing 
      the cases judged to have SAPHO syndrome that fulfilled Kahn's classification 
      criteria based on a combination of concise radiology reports and skin lesions 
      such as palmoplantar pustulosis, with cases diagnosed with SAPHO syndrome by 
      rheumatologists based on all clinical information. The diagnostic performance of 
      the large language model was verified. RESULTS: The diagnostic accuracy of a 
      large language model for analyzing bone scintigraphy radiology reports in 
      conjunction with information about skin symptoms, such as palmoplantar 
      pustulosis, achieved a sensitivity of 83.5%, specificity of 69.4%, and an overall 
      accuracy of 76.8%. DISCUSSION: While this research is an initial endeavor 
      dedicated to the utilization of a substantial language model in the creation of a 
      database for imaging diagnostics of rheumatic conditions, it exhibits commendable 
      diagnostic accuracy, particularly for diseases with a wide range of symptoms like 
      SAPHO syndrome, indicating a positive outlook for subsequent studies. CONCLUSION: 
      This research indicates the prospective value of extensive language models in 
      scrutinizing radiology accounts from bone scintigraphy for the diagnosis of SAPHO 
      syndrome.

AB  - The emergence of ChatGPT has sensitized the general public, including the legal 
      profession, to large language models' (LLMs) potential uses (e.g., document 
      drafting, question answering, and summarization). Although recent studies have 
      shown how well the technology performs in diverse semantic annotation tasks 
      focused on legal texts, an influx of newer, more capable (GPT-4) or 
      cost-effective (GPT-3.5-turbo) models requires another analysis. This paper 
      addresses recent developments in the ability of LLMs to semantically annotate 
      legal texts in zero-shot learning settings. Given the transition to mature 
      generative AI systems, we examine the performance of GPT-4 and 
      GPT-3.5-turbo(-16k), comparing it to the previous generation of GPT models, on 
      three legal text annotation tasks involving diverse documents such as 
      adjudicatory opinions, contractual clauses, or statutory provisions. We also 
      compare the models' performance and cost to better understand the trade-offs. We 
      found that the GPT-4 model clearly outperforms the GPT-3.5 models on two of the 
      three tasks. The cost-effective GPT-3.5-turbo matches the performance of the 20Ã 
      more expensive text-davinci-003 model. While one can annotate multiple data 
      points within a single prompt, the performance degrades as the size of the batch 
      increases. This work provides valuable information relevant for many practical 
      applications (e.g., in contract review) and research projects (e.g., in empirical 
      legal studies). Legal scholars and practicing lawyers alike can leverage these 
      findings to guide their decisions in integrating LLMs in a wide range of 
      workflows involving semantic annotation of legal texts.

AB  - Despite the widespread availability of artificial intelligence (AI) products and 
      services, consumer evaluations and adoption intentions have not met expectations. 
      Existing research mainly focuses on AI's instrumental attributes from the 
      consumer perspective, along with negative impacts of AI failures on evaluations 
      and willingness to use. However, research is lacking on AI as a collaborative 
      agent, investigating the impact of human-AI collaboration on AI acceptance under 
      different outcome expectations. This study examines the interactive effects of 
      human-AI collaboration types (AI-dominant vs. AI-assisted) and outcome 
      expectations (positive vs. negative) on AI product evaluations and usage 
      willingness, along with the underlying mechanisms, from a human-AI relationship 
      perspective. It also investigates the moderating role of algorithm transparency 
      in these effects. Using three online experiments with analysis of variance and 
      bootstrap methods, the study validates these interactive mechanisms, revealing 
      the mediating role of attribution and moderating role of algorithm transparency. 
      Experiment 1 confirms the interactive effects of human-AI collaboration types and 
      outcome expectations on consumer evaluations and usage willingness. Under 
      positive outcome expectations, consumers evaluate and express willingness to use 
      AI-dominant intelligent vehicles with autonomous driving capabilities higher than 
      those with emergency evasion capabilities (AI-assisted). However, under negative 
      outcome expectations, consumers rate autonomous driving capabilities lower 
      compared to emergency evasion capabilities. Experiment 2 examines the mediating 
      role of attribution through ChatGPT's dominant or assisting role under different 
      outcome expectations. Experiment 3 uses a clinical decision-making system to 
      study algorithm transparency's moderating role, showing higher transparency 
      improves evaluations and willingness to use AI products and services under 
      negative outcome expectations. Theoretically, this study advances consumer 
      behavior research by exploring the human-AI relationship within artificial 
      intelligence, enhancing understanding of consumer acceptance variations. 
      Practically, it offers insights for better integrating AI products and services 
      into the market.

TI  - Detection of AI-Created Images Using Pixel-Wise Feature Extraction and 
      Convolutional Neural Networks.
LID - 10.3390/s23229037 [doi]
LID - 9037
AB  - Generative AI has gained enormous interest nowadays due to new applications like 
      ChatGPT, DALL E, Stable Diffusion, and Deepfake. In particular, DALL E, Stable 
      Diffusion, and others (Adobe Firefly, ImagineArt, etc.) can create images from a 
      text prompt and are even able to create photorealistic images. Due to this fact, 
      intense research has been performed to create new image forensics applications 
      able to distinguish between real captured images and videos and artificial ones. 
      Detecting forgeries made with Deepfake is one of the most researched issues. This 
      paper is about another kind of forgery detection. The purpose of this research is 
      to detect photorealistic AI-created images versus real photos coming from a 
      physical camera. Id est, making a binary decision over an image, asking whether 
      it is artificially or naturally created. Artificial images do not need to try to 
      represent any real object, person, or place. For this purpose, techniques that 
      perform a pixel-level feature extraction are used. The first one is Photo 
      Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU). PRNU is a special noise due to imperfections on 
      the camera sensor that is used for source camera identification. The underlying 
      idea is that AI images will have a different PRNU pattern. The second one is 
      error level analysis (ELA). This is another type of feature extraction 
      traditionally used for detecting image editing. ELA is being used nowadays by 
      photographers for the manual detection of AI-created images. Both kinds of 
      features are used to train convolutional neural networks to differentiate between 
      AI images and real photographs. Good results are obtained, achieving accuracy 
      rates of over 95%. Both extraction methods are carefully assessed by computing 
      precision/recall and F(1)-score measurements.

TI  - The importance of transparency: Declaring the use of generative artificial 
      intelligence (AI) in academic writing.
PG  - 314-318
LID - 10.1111/jnu.12938 [doi]
AB  - The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) into academic research 
      writing has revolutionized the field, offering powerful tools like ChatGPT and 
      Bard to aid researchers in content generation and idea enhancement. We explore 
      the current state of transparency regarding generative AI use in nursing academic 
      research journals, emphasizing the need for explicitly declaring the use of 
      generative AI by authors in the manuscript. Out of 125 nursing studies journals, 
      37.6% required explicit statements about generative AI use in their authors' 
      guidelines. No significant differences in impact factors or journal categories 
      were found between journals with and without such requirement. A similar 
      evaluation of medicine, general and internal journals showed a lower percentage 
      (14.5%) including the information about generative AI usage. Declaring generative 
      AI tool usage is crucial for maintaining the transparency and credibility in 
      academic writing. Additionally, extending the requirement for AI usage 
      declarations to journal reviewers can enhance the quality of peer review and 
      combat predatory journals in the academic publishing landscape. Our study 
      highlights the need for active participation from nursing researchers in 
      discussions surrounding standardization of generative AI declaration in academic 
      research writing.

TI  - How large language models can augment perioperative medicine: a daring discourse.
PG  - 575-577
LID - 10.1136/rapm-2023-104637 [doi]
AB  - Interest in natural language processing, specifically large language models, for 
      clinical applications has exploded in a matter of several months since the 
      introduction of ChatGPT. Large language models are powerful and impressive. It is 
      important that we understand the strengths and limitations of this rapidly 
      evolving technology so that we can brainstorm its future potential in 
      perioperative medicine. In this daring discourse, we discuss the issues with 
      these large language models and how we should proactively think about how to 
      leverage these models into practice to improve patient care, rather than worry 
      that it may take over clinical decision-making. We review three potential major 
      areas in which it may be used to benefit perioperative medicine: (1) clinical 
      decision support and surveillance tools, (2) improved aggregation and analysis of 
      research data related to large retrospective studies and application in 
      predictive modeling, and (3) optimized documentation for quality measurement, 
      monitoring and billing compliance. These large language models are here to stay 
      and, as perioperative providers, we can either adapt to this technology or be 
      curtailed by those who learn to use it well.

PG  - 165-176
LID - 10.1007/s11914-023-00847-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review examines the linked pathophysiology of Alzheimer's 
      disease/related dementia (AD/ADRD) and bone disorders like osteoporosis. The 
      emphasis is on "inflammaging"-a low-level inflammation common to both, and its 
      implications in an aging population. RECENT FINDINGS: Aging intensifies both ADRD 
      and bone deterioration. Notably, ADRD patients have a heightened fracture risk, 
      impacting morbidity and mortality, though it is uncertain if fractures worsen 
      ADRD. Therapeutically, agents targeting inflammation pathways, especially&nbsp;Nuclear 
      factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) and TNF-Î±, appear 
      beneficial for both conditions. Additionally, treatments like Sirtuin 1 (SIRT-1), 
      known for anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties, are gaining 
      attention. The interconnectedness of AD/ADRD and bone health necessitates a 
      unified treatment approach. By addressing shared mechanisms, we can potentially 
      transform therapeutic strategies, enriching our understanding and refining care 
      in our aging society.&nbsp;This review article is part of a series of multiple 
      manuscripts designed to determine the utility of using artificial intelligence 
      for writing scientific reviews.

AB  - The GPT-4 large language model (LLM) and ChatGPT chatbot have emerged as 
      accessible and capable tools for generating English-language text in a variety of 
      formats. GPT-4 has previously performed well when applied to questions from 
      multiple standardized examinations. However, further evaluation of 
      trustworthiness and accuracy of GPT-4 responses across various knowledge domains 
      is essential before its use as a reference resource. Here, we assess GPT-4 
      performance on nine graduate-level examinations in the biomedical sciences (seven 
      blinded), finding that GPT-4 scores exceed the student average in seven of nine 
      cases and exceed all student scores for four exams. GPT-4 performed very well on 
      fill-in-the-blank, short-answer, and essay questions, and correctly answered 
      several questions on figures sourced from published manuscripts. Conversely, 
      GPT-4 performed poorly on questions with figures containing simulated data and 
      those requiring a hand-drawn answer. Two GPT-4 answer-sets were flagged as 
      plagiarism based on answer similarity and some model responses included detailed 
      hallucinations. In addition to assessing GPT-4 performance, we discuss patterns 
      and limitations in GPT-4 capabilities with the goal of informing design of future 
      academic examinations in the chatbot era.

      ChatGPT (based on GPT-3.5) and GPT-4 with two temperature parameter values, on 
      the Polish Medical Final Examination (MFE). The models were tested on three 
      editions of the MFE from: Spring 2022, Autumn 2022, and Spring 2023 in two 
      language versions-English and Polish. The accuracies of both models were compared 
      and the relationships between the correctness of answers with the answer's 
      metrics were investigated. The study demonstrated that GPT-4 outperformed GPT-3.5 
      in all three examinations regardless of the language used. GPT-4 achieved mean 
      accuracies of 79.7% for both Polish and English versions, passing all MFE 
      versions. GPT-3.5 had mean accuracies of 54.8% for Polish and 60.3% for English, 
      passing none and 2 of 3 Polish versions for temperature parameter equal to 0 and 
      1 respectively while passing all English versions regardless of the temperature 
      parameter value. GPT-4 score was mostly lower than the average score of a medical 
      student. There was a statistically significant correlation between the 
      correctness of the answers and the index of difficulty for both models. The 
      overall accuracy of both models was still suboptimal and worse than the average 
      for medical students. This emphasizes the need for further improvements in LLMs 
      before they can be reliably deployed in medical settings. These findings suggest 
      an increasing potential for the usage of LLMs in terms of medical education.

AB  - Recently developed chatbots based on large language models (further called bots) 
      have promising features which could facilitate medical education. Several bots 
      are freely available, but their proficiency has been insufficiently evaluated. In 
      this study the authors have tested the current performance on the multiple-choice 
      medical licensing exam of University of Antwerp (Belgium) of six widely used 
      bots: ChatGPT (OpenAI), Bard (Google), New Bing (Microsoft), Claude instant 
      (Anthropic), Claude+ (Anthropic) and GPT-4 (OpenAI). The primary outcome was the 
      performance on the exam expressed as a proportion of correct answers. Secondary 
      analyses were done for a variety of features in the exam questions: easy versus 
      difficult questions, grammatically positive versus negative questions, and 
      clinical vignettes versus theoretical questions. Reasoning errors and untruthful 
      statements (hallucinations) in the bots' answers were examined. All bots passed 
      the exam; Bing and GPT-4 (both 76% correct answers) outperformed the other bots 
      (62-67%, p = 0.03) and students (61%). Bots performed worse on difficult 
      questions (62%, p = 0.06), but outperformed students (32%) on those questions 
      even more (p&lt;0.01). Hallucinations were found in 7% of Bing's and GPT4's answers, 
      significantly lower than Bard (22%, p&lt;0.01) and Claude Instant (19%, p = 0.02). 
      Although the creators of all bots try to some extent to avoid their bots being 
      used as a medical doctor, none of the tested bots succeeded as none refused to 
      answer all clinical case questions.Bing was able to detect weak or ambiguous exam 
      questions. Bots could be used as a time efficient tool to improve the quality of 
      a multiple-choice exam.

TI  - ChIP-GPT: a managed large language model for robust data extraction from 
      biomedical database records.
LID - 10.1093/bib/bbad535 [doi]
LID - bbad535
AB  - Increasing volumes of biomedical data are amassing in databases. Large-scale 
      analyses of these data have wide-ranging applications in biology and medicine. 
      Such analyses require tools to characterize and process entries at scale. 
      However, existing tools, mainly centered on extracting predefined fields, often 
      fail to comprehensively process database entries or correct evident errors-a task 
      humans can easily perform. These tools also lack the ability to reason like 
      domain experts, hindering their robustness and analytical depth. Recent advances 
      with large language models (LLMs) provide a fundamentally new way to query 
      databases. But while a tool such as ChatGPT is adept at answering questions about 
      manually input records, challenges arise when scaling up this process. First, 
      interactions with the LLM need to be automated. Second, limitations on input 
      length may require a record pruning or summarization pre-processing step. Third, 
      to behave reliably as desired, the LLM needs either well-designed, short, 
      'few-shot' examples, or fine-tuning based on a larger set of well-curated 
      examples. Here, we report ChIP-GPT, based on fine-tuning of the generative 
      pre-trained transformer (GPT) model Llama and on a program prompting the model 
      iteratively and handling its generation of answer text. This model is designed to 
      extract metadata from the Sequence Read Archive, emphasizing the identification 
      of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) targets and cell lines. When trained with 
      100 examples, ChIP-GPT demonstrates 90-94% accuracy. Notably, it can seamlessly 
      extract data from records with typos or absent field labels. Our proposed method 
      is easily adaptable to customized questions and different databases.

TI  - A Study on Generative Models for Visual Recognition of Unknown Scenes Using a 
      Textual Description.
LID - 10.3390/s23218757 [doi]
LID - 8757
AB  - In this study, we investigate the application of generative models to assist 
      artificial agents, such as delivery drones or service robots, in visualising 
      unfamiliar destinations solely based on textual descriptions. We explore the use 
      of generative models, such as Stable Diffusion, and embedding representations, 
      such as CLIP and VisualBERT, to compare generated images obtained from textual 
      descriptions of target scenes with images of those scenes. Our research 
      encompasses three key strategies: image generation, text generation, and text 
      enhancement, the latter involving tools such as ChatGPT to create concise textual 
      descriptions for evaluation. The findings of this study contribute to an 
      understanding of the impact of combining generative tools with multi-modal 
      embedding representations to enhance the artificial agent's ability to recognise 
      unknown scenes. Consequently, we assert that this research holds broad 
      applications, particularly in drone parcel delivery, where an aerial robot can 
      employ text descriptions to identify a destination. Furthermore, this concept can 
      also be applied to other service robots tasked with delivering to unfamiliar 
      locations, relying exclusively on user-provided textual descriptions.

AB  - The success of foundation models such as ChatGPT and AlphaFold has spurred 
      significant interest in building similar models for electronic medical records 
      (EMRs) to improve patient care and hospital operations. However, recent hype has 
      obscured critical gaps in our understanding of these models' capabilities. In 
      this narrative review, we examine 84 foundation models trained on non-imaging EMR 
      data (i.e., clinical text and/or structured data) and create a taxonomy 
      delineating their architectures, training data, and potential use cases. We find 
      that most models are trained on small, narrowly-scoped clinical datasets (e.g., 
      MIMIC-III) or broad, public biomedical corpora (e.g., PubMed) and are evaluated 
      on tasks that do not provide meaningful insights on their usefulness to health 
      systems. Considering these findings, we propose an improved evaluation framework 
      for measuring the benefits of clinical foundation models that is more closely 
      grounded to metrics that matter in healthcare.

BTI - Chatbots in Health Care: Connecting Patients to Information: Emerging Health 
      Technologies
AB  - WHY IS THIS AN ISSUE? Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used in 
      health care settings. Chatbots geared toward patient use are becoming more widely 
      available, but the clinical evidence of their effectiveness remains limited. WHAT 
      IS THE TECHNOLOGY? AI-based chatbots are computer programs or software 
      applications that have been designed to engage in simulated conversation with 
      humans using humanlike language. Chatbots can help humans save time and allow 
      them to focus on more high-level creative or strategic thinking by taking over 
      more routine or repetitive tasks, such as automated customer service chats, 
      appointments, or staff scheduling. WHAT IS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT? Anyone with 
      access to an internet-enabled computer or a smartphone could use these chatbots 
      to access health information. Chatbots can provide patients with 24/7 access to 
      health information, such as symptom assessment, supportive information, 
      medication reminders, or appointment scheduling, allowing access to information 
      when health care providers are unavailable. There appear to be trends toward 
      efficacy and user satisfaction, but the evidence to support the clinical 
      effectiveness of chatbots in health care is still being established. Existing 
      health care chatbots are mostly free for patients to access, although some 
      developers and health care providers charge fees to access additional features or 
      content. Some apps may be prescribed to patients by providers. These could be 
      covered by insurance or licensed to health care providers by the developer. WHAT 
      ELSE DO WE NEED TO KNOW? Ethical and data privacy issues remain top of mind when 
      considering the widespread implementation of chatbots for patient use in health 
      care settings. ChatGPT and other AI tools that were not developed specifically 
      for health care do not necessarily provide the level of data privacy that is 
      required of health care information. They are also trained on historical datasets 
      and do not provide responses based on the most current clinical recommendations 
      or health data. The development of AI-specific ethical frameworks could 
      facilitate safer and more consistent development of AI tools in health care by 
      preventing the misuse of AI technologies and minimizing the spread of 
      misinformation. AI tools still require human oversight in terms of moderation and 
      troubleshooting.

TI  - GeneGPT: augmenting large language models with domain tools for improved access 
      to biomedical information.
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btae075 [doi]
LID - btae075
AB  - MOTIVATION: While large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to 
      various tasks, they still face challenges with hallucinations. Augmenting LLMs 
      with domain-specific tools such as database utilities can facilitate easier and 
      more precise access to specialized knowledge. In this article, we present 
      GeneGPT, a novel method for teaching LLMs to use the Web APIs of the National 
      Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) for answering genomics questions. 
      Specifically, we prompt Codex to solve the GeneTuring tests with NCBI Web APIs by 
      in-context learning and an augmented decoding algorithm that can detect and 
      execute API calls. RESULTS: Experimental results show that GeneGPT achieves 
      state-of-the-art performance on eight tasks in the GeneTuring benchmark with an 
      average score of 0.83, largely surpassing retrieval-augmented LLMs such as the 
      new Bing (0.44), biomedical LLMs such as BioMedLM (0.08) and BioGPT (0.04), as 
      well as GPT-3 (0.16) and ChatGPT (0.12). Our further analyses suggest that: 
      First, API demonstrations have good cross-task generalizability and are more 
      useful than documentations for in-context learning; second, GeneGPT can 
      generalize to longer chains of API calls and answer multi-hop questions in 
      GeneHop, a novel dataset introduced in this work; finally, different types of 
      errors are enriched in different tasks, providing valuable insights for future 
      improvements. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The GeneGPT code and data are 
      publicly available at https://github.com/ncbi/GeneGPT.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies such as Generative AI 
      (GenAI) have become more common in academic settings, it is necessary to examine 
      how these tools interact with issues of authorship, academic integrity, and 
      research methodologies. The current landscape lacks cohesive policies and 
      guidelines for regulating AI's role in academic research which has prompted 
      discussions among publishers, authors, and institutions. METHODS: This study 
      employs inductive thematic analysis to explore publisher policies regarding 
      AI-assisted authorship and academic work. Our methods involved a two-fold 
      analysis using both AI-assisted and traditional unassisted techniques to examine 
      the available policies from leading academic publishers and other publishing or 
      academic entities. The framework was designed to offer multiple perspectives, 
      harnessing the strengths of AI for pattern recognition while leveraging human 
      expertise for nuanced interpretation. The results of these two analyses are 
      combined to form the final themes. RESULTS: Our findings indicate six overall 
      themes, three of which were independently identified in both the AI-assisted and 
      unassisted, manual analysis using common software tools. A broad consensus 
      appears among publishers that human authorship remains paramount and that the use 
      of GenAI tools is permissible but must be disclosed. However, GenAI tools are 
      increasingly acknowledged for their supportive roles, including text generation 
      and data analysis. The study also discusses the inherent limitations and biases 
      of AI-assisted analysis, necessitating rigorous scrutiny by authors, reviewers, 
      and editors. CONCLUSIONS: There is a growing recognition of AI's role as a 
      valuable auxiliary tool in academic research, but one that comes with caveats 
      pertaining to integrity, accountability, and interpretive limitations. This study 
      used a novel analysis supported by GenAI tools to identify themes emerging in the 
      policy landscape, underscoring the need for an informed, flexible approach to 
      policy formulation that can adapt to the rapidly evolving landscape of AI 
      technologies.

AB  - Drawing sound causal inferences from observational data is often challenging for 
      both authors and reviewers. This paper discusses the design and application of an 
      Artificial Intelligence Causal Research Assistant (AIA) that seeks to help 
      authors improve causal inferences and conclusions drawn from epidemiological data 
      in health risk assessments. The AIA-assisted review process provides structured 
      reviews and recommendations for improving the causal reasoning, analyses and 
      interpretations made in scientific papers based on epidemiological data. Causal 
      analysis methodologies range from earlier Bradford-Hill considerations to current 
      causal directed acyclic graph (DAG) and related models. AIA seeks to make these 
      methods more accessible and useful to researchers. AIA uses an external script (a 
      "Causal AI Booster" (CAB) program based on classical AI concepts of slot-filling 
      in frames organized into task hierarchies to complete goals) to guide Large 
      Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's LaMDA (Bard), to 
      systematically review manuscripts and create both (a) recommendations for what to 
      do to improve analyses and reporting; and (b) explanations and support for the 
      recommendations. Review tables and summaries are completed systematically by the 
      LLM in order. For example, recommendations for how to state and caveat causal 
      conclusions in the Abstract and Discussion sections reflect previous analyses of 
      the Study Design and Data Analysis sections. This work illustrates how current AI 
      can contribute to reviewing and providing constructive feedback on research 
      documents. We believe that such AI-assisted review shows promise for enhancing 
      the quality of causal reasoning and exposition in epidemiological studies. It 
      suggests the potential for effective human-AI collaboration in scientific 
      authoring and review processes.

TI  - Comprehensive Review of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Vascular Surgery.
PG  - 57-63
LID - 10.1016/j.ejvsvf.2023.09.002 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has attracted increased 
      interest in healthcare with various potential applications including 
      identification and extraction of health information, development of chatbots and 
      virtual assistants. The aim of this comprehensive literature review was to 
      provide an overview of NLP applications in vascular surgery, identify current 
      limitations, and discuss future perspectives in the field. DATA SOURCES: The 
      MEDLINE database was searched on April 2023. REVIEW METHODS: The database was 
      searched using a combination of keywords to identify studies reporting the use of 
      NLP and chatbots in three main vascular diseases. Keywords used included Natural 
      Language Processing, chatbot, chatGPT, aortic disease, carotid, peripheral artery 
      disease, vascular, and vascular surgery. RESULTS: Given the heterogeneity of 
      study design, techniques, and aims, a comprehensive literature review was 
      performed to provide an overview of NLP applications in vascular surgery. By 
      enabling identification and extraction of information on patients with vascular 
      diseases, such technology could help to analyse data from healthcare information 
      systems to provide feedback on current practice and help in optimising patient 
      care. In addition, chatbots and NLP driven techniques have the potential to be 
      used as virtual assistants for both health professionals and patients. 
      CONCLUSION: While Artificial Intelligence and NLP technology could be used to 
      enhance care for patients with vascular diseases, many challenges remain 
      including the need to define guidelines and clear consensus on how to evaluate 
      and validate these innovations before their implementation into clinical 
      practice.

AB  - Objective The primary aim of this research was to address the limitations 
      observed in the medical knowledge of prevalent large language models (LLMs) such 
      as ChatGPT, by creating a specialized language model with enhanced accuracy in 
      medical advice. Methods We achieved this by adapting and refining the large 
      language model meta-AI (LLaMA)&nbsp;using a large dataset of 100,000 patient-doctor 
      dialogues sourced from a widely used online medical consultation platform. These 
      conversations were cleaned and anonymized to respect privacy concerns. In 
      addition to the model refinement, we incorporated a self-directed information 
      retrieval mechanism, allowing the model to access and utilize real-time 
      information from online sources like Wikipedia and data from curated offline 
      medical databases. Results The fine-tuning of the model with real-world 
      patient-doctor interactions significantly improved the model's ability to 
      understand patient needs and provide informed advice. By equipping the model with 
      self-directed information retrieval from reliable online and offline sources, we 
      observed substantial improvements in the accuracy of its responses. Conclusion 
      Our proposed ChatDoctor, represents a significant advancement in medical LLMs, 
      demonstrating a significant improvement in understanding patient inquiries and 
      providing accurate advice. Given the high stakes and low error tolerance in the 
      medical field, such enhancements in providing accurate and reliable information 
      are not only beneficial but essential.

TI  - Algorithmic bias and research integrity; the role of nonhuman authors in shaping 
      scientific knowledge with respect to artificial intelligence: a perspective.
PG  - 2987-2990
LID - 10.1097/JS9.0000000000000552 [doi]
AB  - Artificial intelligence technologies were developed to assist authors in 
      bettering the organization and caliber of their published papers, which are both 
      growing in quantity and sophistication. Even though the usage of artificial 
      intelligence tools in particular ChatGPT's natural language processing systems 
      has been shown to be beneficial in research, there are still concerns about 
      accuracy, responsibility, and transparency when it comes to the norms regarding 
      authorship credit and contributions. Genomic algorithms quickly examine large 
      amounts of genetic data to identify potential disease-causing mutations. By 
      analyzing millions of medications for potential therapeutic benefits, they can 
      quickly and relatively economically find novel approaches to treatment. 
      Researchers from several fields can collaborate on difficult tasks with the 
      assistance of nonhuman writers, promoting interdisciplinary research. Sadly, 
      there are a number of significant disadvantages associated with employing 
      nonhuman authors, including the potential for algorithmic prejudice. Biased data 
      may be reinforced by the algorithm since machine learning algorithms can only be 
      as objective as the data they are trained on. It is overdue that scholars bring 
      forth basic moral concerns in the fight against algorithmic prejudice. Overall, 
      even if the use of nonhuman authors has the potential to significantly improve 
      scientific research, it is crucial for scientists to be aware of these drawbacks 
      and take precautions to avoid bias and limits. To provide accurate and objective 
      results, algorithms must be carefully designed and implemented, and researchers 
      need to be mindful of the larger ethical ramifications of their usage.

TI  - Medical School Admissions: Focusing on Producing a Physician Workforce That 
      Addresses the Needs of the United States.
PG  - 983-986
LID - 10.1097/ACM.0000000000005262 [doi]
AB  - The aging population, burnout, and earlier retirement of physicians along with 
      the static number of training positions are likely to worsen the current 
      physician shortage. There is an urgent need to transform the process for 
      selecting medical students. In this Invited Commentary, the authors suggest that 
      to build the physician workforce that the United States needs for the future, 
      academic medicine should focus on building capacity in 3 overarching areas. 
      First, medical schools need to develop a more diverse pool of capable applicants 
      that better matches the demographic characteristics of health care trainees with 
      those of the population, and they need to nurture applicants with diverse career 
      aspirations. Second, medical schools should recalibrate their student selection 
      process, aligning criteria for admission with competencies expected of medical 
      school graduates, whether they choose to become practicing clinicians, 
      physician-scientists, members of the public health workforce, or policy makers. 
      Selection criteria that overweight the results of standardized test scores should 
      be replaced by assessments that value and predict academic capacity, adaptive 
      learning skills, curiosity, compassion, empathy, emotional maturity, and superior 
      communication skills. Finally, to improve the equity and effectiveness of the 
      selection processes, medical schools should leverage innovations in data science 
      and generative artificial intelligence platforms. The ability of ChatGPT to pass 
      the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) demonstrates the 
      decreasing importance of memorization in medicine in favor of critical thinking 
      and problem-solving skills. The 2022 change in the USMLE Step 1 to pass/fail plus 
      the exodus of several prominent medical schools from the U.S. News and World 
      Report rankings have exposed limitations of the current selection processes. 
      Newer approaches that use precision education systems to leverage data and 
      technology can help address these limitations.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence in Hand Surgery - How Generative AI is Transforming the 
      Hand Surgery Landscape.
PG  - 81-87
LID - 10.1142/S2424835524300019 [doi]
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has witnessed significant advancements, reshaping 
      various industries, including healthcare. The introduction of ChatGPT by OpenAI 
      in November 2022 marked a pivotal moment, showcasing the potential of generative 
      AI in revolutionising patient care, diagnosis and treatment. Generative AI, 
      unlike traditional AI systems, possesses the ability to generate new content by 
      understanding patterns within datasets. This article explores the evolution of AI 
      in healthcare, tracing its roots to the term coined by John McCarthy in 1955 and 
      the contributions of pioneers like John Von Neumann and Alan Turing. Currently, 
      generative AI, particularly Large Language Models, holds promise across three 
      broad categories in healthcare: patient care, education and research. In patient 
      care, it offers solutions in clinical document management, diagnostic support and 
      operative planning. Notable advancements include Microsoft's collaboration with 
      Epic for integrating AI into electronic medical records (EMRs), enhancing 
      clinical data management and patient care. Furthermore, generative AI aids in 
      surgical decision-making, as demonstrated in plastic, orthopaedic and 
      hepatobiliary surgeries. However, challenges such as bias, hallucination and 
      integration with EMR systems necessitate caution and ongoing evaluation. The 
      article also presents insights from the implementation of NUHS Russell-GPT, a 
      generative AI chatbot, in a hand surgery department, showcasing its utility in 
      administrative tasks but highlighting challenges in surgical planning and EMR 
      integration. The survey showed unanimous support for incorporating AI into 
      clinical settings, with all respondents being open to its use. In conclusion, 
      generative AI is poised to enhance patient care and ease physician workloads, 
      starting with automating administrative tasks and evolving to inform diagnoses, 
      tailored treatment plans, as well as aid in surgical planning. As healthcare 
      systems navigate the complexities of integrating AI, the potential benefits for 
      both physicians and patients remain significant, offering a glimpse into a future 
      where AI transforms healthcare delivery. Level of Evidence: Level V (Diagnostic).

      Evidence.
PG  - 135-145
LID - 10.1007/s11914-023-00843-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: SARS-CoV-2 infection, the culprit of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
      has been associated with significant long-term effects on various organ systems, 
      including bone health. This review explores the current understanding of the 
      impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection on bone health and its potential long-term 
      consequences. RECENT FINDINGS: As part of the post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 
      infection, bone health changes are affected by COVID-19 both directly and 
      indirectly, with multiple potential mechanisms and risk factors involved. In 
      vitro and preclinical studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may directly infect bone 
      marrow cells, leading to alterations in bone structure and osteoclast numbers. 
      The virus can also trigger a robust inflammatory response, often referred to as a 
      "cytokine storm", which can stimulate osteoclast activity and contribute to bone 
      loss. Clinical evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may lead to hypocalcemia, 
      altered bone turnover markers, and a high prevalence of vertebral fractures. 
      Furthermore, disease severity has been correlated with a decrease in bone mineral 
      density. Indirect effects of SARS-CoV-2 on bone health, mediated through muscle 
      weakness, mechanical unloading, nutritional deficiencies, and corticosteroid use, 
      also contribute to the long-term consequences. The interplay of concurrent 
      conditions such as diabetes, obesity, and kidney dysfunction with SARS-CoV-2 
      infection further complicates the disease's impact on bone health. SARS-CoV-2 
      infection directly and indirectly affects bone health, leading to potential 
      long-term consequences.&nbsp;This review article is part of a series of multiple 
      manuscripts designed to determine the utility of using artificial intelligence 
      for writing scientific reviews.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Artificial intelligence (AI) based large language models (LLM) 
      contain enormous potential in education and training. Recent publications 
      demonstrated that they are able to outperform participants in written medical 
      exams. RESEARCH QUESTION: We aimed to explore the accuracy of AI in the written 
      part of the EANS board exam. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty-six representative 
      single best answer (SBA) questions, included at least ten times in prior EANS 
      board exams, were selected by the current EANS board exam committee. The 
      questions' content was classified as 75 text-based (TB) and 11 image-based (IB) 
      and their structure as 50 interpretation-weighted, 30 theory-based and 6 
      true-or-false. Questions were tested with Chat GPT 3.5, Bing and Bard. The AI and 
      participant results were statistically analyzed through ANOVA tests with Stata SE 
      15 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). P-values of &lt;0.05 were considered as 
      statistically significant. RESULTS: The Bard LLM achieved the highest accuracy 
      with 62% correct questions overall and 69% excluding IB, outperforming human exam 
      participants 59% (p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.67) and 59% (p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.42), respectively. All LLMs scored 
      highest in theory-based questions, excluding IB questions (Chat-GPT: 79%; Bing: 
      83%; Bard: 86%) and significantly better than the human exam participants (60%; 
      p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.03). AI could not answer any IB question correctly. DISCUSSION AND 
      CONCLUSION: AI passed the written EANS board exam based on representative SBA 
      questions and achieved results close to or even better than the human exam 
      participants. Our results raise several ethical and practical implications, which 
      may impact the current concept for the written EANS board exam.

AB  - Background: As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to advance with 
      breakthroughs in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML), 
      such as the development of models like OpenAI's ChatGPT, new opportunities are 
      emerging for efficient curation of electronic health records (EHR) into 
      real-world data (RWD) for evidence generation in oncology. Our objective is to 
      describe the research and development of industry methods to promote transparency 
      and explainability. Methods: We applied NLP with ML techniques to train, 
      validate, and test the extraction of information from unstructured documents 
      (e.g., clinician notes, radiology reports, lab reports, etc.) to output a set of 
      structured variables required for RWD analysis. This research used a nationwide 
      electronic health record (EHR)-derived database. Models were selected based on 
      performance. Variables curated with an approach using ML extraction are those 
      where the value is determined solely based on an ML model (i.e. not confirmed by 
      abstraction), which identifies key information from visit notes and documents. 
      These models do not predict future events or infer missing information. Results: 
      We developed an approach using NLP and ML for extraction of clinically meaningful 
      information from unstructured EHR documents and found high performance of output 
      variables compared with variables curated by manually abstracted data. These 
      extraction methods resulted in research-ready variables including initial cancer 
      diagnosis with date, advanced/metastatic diagnosis with date, disease stage, 
      histology, smoking status, surgery status with date, biomarker test results with 
      dates, and oral treatments with dates. Conclusion: NLP and ML enable the 
      extraction of retrospective clinical data in EHR with speed and scalability to 
      help researchers learn from the experience of every person with cancer.

LID - 102339
AB  - The need for technical support for data handling and visualization solutions has 
      increased in tandem with the complexity of today's data and information, that is 
      of multiple sources, huge in size and of different formats. This study focuses on 
      handling and analyzing text-based data. Despite many available text analysis 
      tools, there is a high demand among researchers for easy- to-use tools yet 
      scalable and with incomparable visualization features. Of recent, there has been 
      a significant focus on utilizing VOSviewer, an open-source software for 
      bibliometric analysis. This software is able to analyze a significant amount of 
      data and provide excellent network data mapping. However, there is a lack of 
      existing work in evaluating this sophisticated tool for text analysis. Thus, this 
      article explores the capability of VOSviewer and presents evidence-based 
      implementation of this software for text analysis. Specifically, this study 
      demonstrates the usage of VOSviewer to analyze text based on YouTube interviews 
      related to ChatGPT. Hence, this study significantly contributes by processing 
      textual data and producing visualization network maps that are different from 
      bibliometric data. The study recognizes VOSviewer as a powerful tool for data 
      visualization in mapping text data and illustrates the potential of this software 
      for analyzing text networks in various fields. â¢The study illustrates how text 
      analysis and visualization can be realized using VOSviewer, an open-source 
      software mostly used for biblio- metric analysis.â¢The study presents the workflow 
      indicating how the dataset can be prepared as input for VOSviewer for text 
      analysis.â¢The study proves that VOSviewer is a powerful tool for data 
      visualization and network mapping for any type of network data including 
      transcripts from social media.

TI  - How Well Do Artificial Intelligence Chatbots Respond to the Top Search Queries 
      About Urological Malignancies?
PG  - 13-16

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are becoming a popular source of 
      information but there are limited data on the quality of information on 
      urological malignancies that they provide. Our objective was to characterize the 
      quality of information and detect misinformation about prostate, bladder, kidney, 
      and testicular cancers from four AI chatbots: ChatGPT, Perplexity, Chat Sonic, 
      and Microsoft Bing AI. We used the top five search queries related to prostate, 
      bladder, kidney, and testicular cancers according to Google Trends from January 
      2021 to January 2023 and input them into the AI chatbots. Responses were 
      evaluated for quality, understandability, actionability, misinformation, and 
      readability using published instruments. AI chatbot responses had moderate to 
      high information quality (median DISCERN score 4 out of 5, range 2-5) and lacked 
      misinformation. Understandability was moderate (median Patient Education Material 
      Assessment Tool for Printable Materials [PEMAT-P] understandability 66.7%, range 
      44.4-90.9%) and actionability was moderate to poor (median PEMAT-P actionability 
      40%, range 0-40%The responses were written at a fairly difficult reading level. 
      AI chatbots produce information that is generally accurate and of moderate to 
      high quality in response to the top urological malignancy-related search queries, 
      but the responses lack clear, actionable instructions and exceed the reading 
      level recommended for consumer health information. PATIENT SUMMARY: Artificial 
      intelligence chatbots produce information that is generally accurate and of 
      moderately high quality in response to popular Google searches about urological 
      cancers. However, their responses are fairly difficult to read, are moderately 
      hard to understand, and lack clear instructions for users to act on.

TI  - Pediatrics in Artificial Intelligence Era: A Systematic Review on Challenges, 
      Opportunities, and Explainability.
PG  - 561-569
AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT 
      and Bard is disrupting a broad swathe of fields, including medicine. In pediatric 
      medicine, AI is also increasingly being used across multiple subspecialties. 
      However, the practical application of AI still faces a number of key challenges. 
      Consequently, there is a requirement for a concise overview of the roles of AI 
      across the multiple domains of pediatric medicine, which the current study seeks 
      to address. AIM: To systematically assess the challenges, opportunities, and 
      explainability of AI in pediatric medicine. METHODOLOGY: A systematic search was 
      carried out on peer-reviewed databases, PubMed Central, Europe PubMed Central, 
      and grey literature using search terms related to machine learning (ML) and AI 
      for the years 2016 to 2022 in the English language. A total of 210 articles were 
      retrieved that were screened with PRISMA for abstract, year, language, context, 
      and proximal relevance to research aims. A thematic analysis was carried out to 
      extract findings from the included studies. RESULTS: Twenty articles were 
      selected for data abstraction and analysis, with three consistent themes emerging 
      from these articles. In particular, eleven articles address the current 
      state-of-the-art application of AI in diagnosing and predicting health conditions 
      such as behavioral and mental health, cancer, syndromic and metabolic diseases. 
      Five articles highlight the specific challenges of AI deployment in pediatric 
      medicines: data security, handling, authentication, and validation. Four articles 
      set out future opportunities for AI to be adapted: the incorporation of Big Data, 
      cloud computing, precision medicine, and clinical decision support systems. These 
      studies collectively critically evaluate the potential of AI in overcoming 
      current barriers to adoption. CONCLUSION: AI is proving disruptive within 
      pediatric medicine and is presently associated with challenges, opportunities, 
      and the need for explainability. AI should be viewed as a tool to enhance and 
      support clinical decision-making rather than a substitute for human judgement and 
      expertise. Future research should consequently focus on obtaining comprehensive 
      data to ensure the generalizability of research findings.

TI  - Integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Large Language Models in 
      Nephrology: Advancing Practical Applications.
LID - 10.3390/medicina60030445 [doi]
LID - 445
AB  - The integration of large language models (LLMs) into healthcare, particularly in 
      nephrology, represents a significant advancement in applying advanced technology 
      to patient care, medical research, and education. These advanced models have 
      progressed from simple text processors to tools capable of deep language 
      understanding, offering innovative ways to handle health-related data, thus 
      improving medical practice efficiency and effectiveness. A significant challenge 
      in medical applications of LLMs is their imperfect accuracy and/or tendency to 
      produce hallucinations-outputs that are factually incorrect or irrelevant. This 
      issue is particularly critical in healthcare, where precision is essential, as 
      inaccuracies can undermine the reliability of these models in crucial 
      decision-making processes. To overcome these challenges, various strategies have 
      been developed. One such strategy is prompt engineering, like the 
      chain-of-thought approach, which directs LLMs towards more accurate responses by 
      breaking down the problem into intermediate steps or reasoning sequences. Another 
      one is the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) strategy, which helps address 
      hallucinations by integrating external data, enhancing output accuracy and 
      relevance. Hence, RAG is favored for tasks requiring up-to-date, comprehensive 
      information, such as in clinical decision making or educational applications. In 
      this article, we showcase the creation of a specialized ChatGPT model integrated 
      with a RAG system, tailored to align with the KDIGO 2023 guidelines for chronic 
      kidney disease. This example demonstrates its potential in providing specialized, 
      accurate medical advice, marking a step towards more reliable and efficient 
      nephrology practices.

TI  - Physicians' and Patients' Expectations From Digital Agents for Consultations: 
      Interview Study Among Physicians and Patients.
PG  - e49647
LID - 10.2196/49647 [doi]
LID - e49647
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physicians are currently overwhelmed by administrative tasks and 
      spend very little time in consultations with patients, which hampers health 
      literacy, shared decision-making, and treatment adherence. OBJECTIVE: This study 
      aims to examine whether digital agents constructed using fast-evolving generative 
      artificial intelligence, such as ChatGPT, have the potential to improve 
      consultations, adherence to treatment, and health literacy. We interviewed 
      patients and physicians to obtain their opinions about 3 digital agents-a silent 
      digital expert, a communicative digital expert, and a digital companion (DC). 
      METHODS: We conducted in-depth interviews with 25 patients and 22 physicians from 
      a purposeful sample, with the patients having a wide age range and coming from 
      different educational backgrounds and the physicians having different medical 
      specialties. Transcripts of the interviews were deductively coded using MAXQDA 
      (VERBI Software GmbH) and then summarized according to code and interview before 
      being clustered for interpretation. RESULTS: Statements from patients and 
      physicians were categorized according to three consultation phases: (1) silent 
      and communicative digital experts that are part of the consultation, (2) digital 
      experts that hand over to a DC, and (3) DCs that support patients in the period 
      between consultations. Overall, patients and physicians were open to these forms 
      of digital support but had reservations about all 3 agents. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Ultimately, we derived 9 requirements for designing digital agents to support 
      consultations, treatment adherence, and health literacy based on the literature 
      and our qualitative findings.

      especially among new nurses. This study aimed to reveal how the nursing work 
      environment, head nurse leadership and presenteeism shape job embeddedness in 
      this population from the perspective of conservation of resources (COR) theory. 
      METHOD: A cross-sectional multicentre study involving 436 participants from 10 
      cities and 33 hospitals was conducted over 4 months. Samples were selected using 
      a two-stage convenience sampling method. A sequential multiple mediation model 
      performed with SPSS-PROCESS was used to analyse the relationships among the 
      nursing work environment, head nurse leadership, presenteeism and job 
      embeddedness. RESULTS: The nursing work environment not only directly affects the 
      job embeddedness of new nurses (Î²â=â0.480, pâ&lt;â0.001) but also indirectly affects 
      it through the sequential multiple mediating effects of head nurse leadership and 
      presenteeism (R(2)â=â0.535, Fâ=â82.160, pâ&lt;â0.001). CONCLUSIONS: New nurses' job 
      embeddedness needs to be improved. These results suggest that preserving adequate 
      resources for new nurses, such as work environment resources, head nurse 
      leadership resources, and individual productivity resources, is an effective way 
      to shape their job embeddedness. In addition, when a certain resource is 
      insufficient, fully considering the principles of investment and buffering 
      between resources and providing reciprocal, alternative, or buffer resources in a 
      timely manner are necessary to improve new nurses' job embeddedness. LARGE 
      LANGUAGE MODELS: Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, were not used 
      during the writing of this article. An expert native English speaker performed 
      language revision.

TI  - Ethical Considerations for Artificial Intelligence in Dermatology: A Scoping 
      Review.
LID - ljae040 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/bjd/ljae040 [doi]
AB  - The field of dermatology is experiencing the rapid deployment of artificial 
      intelligence (AI), from mobile applications for skin cancer detection to large 
      language models like ChatGPT that can answer generalist or specialist questions 
      about skin diagnoses. With these new applications, ethical concerns have emerged. 
      In this scoping review, we aim to identify the applications of AI to the field of 
      dermatology and to understand their ethical implications. We utilized a 
      multifaceted search approach, searching PubMed, Medline, Cochrane, and Google 
      Scholar for primary literature according to the Preferred Reporting Items for 
      Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) Extension for Scoping Reviews. Our 
      advanced query included terms related to dermatology, artificial intelligence, 
      and ethical considerations. Our search yielded a total of 202 papers. After 
      initial screening, 68 studies were included. Thirty-two related to clinical image 
      analysis and raised ethical concerns for misdiagnosis, data security, violations 
      of privacy, and replacement of dermatologist jobs. Seventeen discussed limited 
      skin of color representation in datasets leading to potential misdiagnosis in the 
      general population. Nine articles about teledermatology raised ethical concerns, 
      including the exacerbation of health disparities, lack of standardized 
      regulations, informed consent for AI use, and privacy challenges. Seven addressed 
      inaccuracies of responses of large language models. Seven examined attitudes and 
      trust towards AI, with most patients requesting supplemental assessment by a 
      physician to ensure reliability and accountability. Benefits of artificial 
      intelligence integration into clinical practice include increased patient access, 
      improved clinical decision making, efficiency, and many others. However, 
      safeguards must be implemented to ensure ethical applications of artificial 
      intelligence.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Coding for neurosurgical procedures is a complex process that is 
      dynamically changing year to year, through the annual introduction and removal of 
      codes and modifiers. The authors hoped to elucidate if publicly available 
      artificial intelligence (AI) could offer solutions for neurosurgeons with regard 
      to coding. METHODS: Multiple publicly available AI platforms were asked to 
      provide Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes and Revenue Value Units (RVU) 
      values for common neurosurgical procedures of the brain and spine with a given 
      indication for the procedure. The responses of platforms were recorded and 
      compared to the currently valid CPT codes used for the procedure and the amount 
      of RVUs that would be gained. RESULTS: Six platforms and Google were asked for 
      the appropriate CPT codes for 10 endovascular, spinal, and cranial procedures 
      each. The highest performing platforms were as follows: Perplexity.AI identified 
      70% of endovascular, BingAI identified 55% of spinal, and ChatGPT 4.0 with Bing 
      identified 75% of cranial CPT codes. With regard to RVUs, the top performer 
      gained 78% of endovascular, 42% of spinal, and 70% of cranial possible RVUs. With 
      regard to accuracy, AI platforms on average outperformed Google (45% vs. 25%, P&nbsp;= 
      0.04236). CONCLUSIONS: The ability of publicly available AIs to successfully code 
      for neurosurgical procedures holds great promise in the future. Future 
      development of AI should focus on improving accuracy with regard to CPT codes and 
      providing supporting documentation for its decisions. Improvement on the existing 
      capabilities of AI platforms can allow for increased operational efficiency and 
      cost savings for practices.

TI  - Mind Gaps and Bone Snaps: Exploring the Connection Between Alzheimer's Disease 
      and Osteoporosis.
LID - 10.1007/s11914-023-00851-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This comprehensive review discusses the complex relationship 
      between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and osteoporosis, two conditions that are 
      prevalent in the aging population and result in adverse complications on quality 
      of life. The purpose of this review is to succinctly elucidate the many 
      commonalities between the two conditions, including shared pathways, inflammatory 
      and oxidative mechanisms, and hormonal deficiencies. RECENT FINDINGS: AD and 
      osteoporosis share many aspects of their respective disease-defining 
      pathophysiology. These commonalities include amyloid beta deposition, the 
      Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway, and estrogen deficiency. The shared mechanisms 
      and risk factors associated with AD and osteoporosis result in a large percentage 
      of patients that develop both diseases. Previous literature has established that 
      the progression of AD increases the risk of sustaining a fracture. Recent 
      findings demonstrate that the reverse may also be true, suggesting that a 
      fracture early in the life course can predispose one to developing AD due to the 
      activation of these shared mechanisms. The discovery of these commonalities 
      further guides the development of novel therapeutics in which both conditions are 
      targeted. This detailed review delves into the commonalities between AD and 
      osteoporosis to uncover the shared players that bring these two seemingly 
      unrelated conditions together. The discussion throughout this review ultimately 
      posits that the occurrence of fractures and the mechanism behind fracture healing 
      can predispose one to developing AD later on in life, similar to how AD patients 
      are at an increased risk of developing fractures. By focusing on the shared 
      mechanisms between AD and osteoporosis, one can better understand the conditions 
      individually and as a unit, thus informing therapeutic approaches and further 
      research. This review article is part of a series of multiple manuscripts 
      designed to determine the utility of using artificial intelligence for writing 
      scientific reviews.

TI  - Role of the Neurologic System in Fracture Healing: An Extensive Review.
PG  - 205-216
LID - 10.1007/s11914-023-00844-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite advances in orthopedics, there remains a need for 
      therapeutics to hasten fracture healing. However, little focus is given to the 
      role the nervous system plays in regulating fracture healing. This paucity of 
      information has led to an incomplete understanding of fracture healing and has 
      limited the development of fracture therapies that integrate the importance of 
      the nervous system. This review seeks to illuminate the integral roles that the 
      nervous system plays in fracture healing. RECENT FINDINGS: Preclinical studies 
      explored several methodologies for ablating peripheral nerves to demonstrate 
      ablation-induced deficits in fracture healing. Conversely, activation of 
      peripheral nerves via the use of dorsal root ganglion electrical stimulation 
      enhanced fracture healing via calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP). 
      Investigations into TLR-4, TrkB agonists, and nerve growth factor (NGF) 
      expression provide valuable insights into molecular pathways influencing bone 
      mesenchymal stem cells and fracture repair. Finally, there is continued research 
      into the connections between pain and fracture healing with findings suggesting 
      that anti-NGF may be able to block pain without affecting healing. This review 
      underscores the critical roles of the central nervous system (CNS), peripheral 
      nervous system (PNS), and autonomic nervous system (ANS) in fracture healing, 
      emphasizing their influence on bone cells, neuropeptide release, and endochondral 
      ossification. The use of TBI models contributes to understanding neural 
      regulation, though the complex influence of TBI on fracture healing requires 
      further exploration. The review concludes by addressing the neural connection to 
      fracture pain. This review article is part of a series of multiple manuscripts 
      designed to determine the utility of using artificial intelligence for writing 
      scientific reviews.

TI  - The Role of Pelvic Exenteration in Cervical Cancer: A Review of the Literature.
LID - 10.3390/cancers16040817 [doi]
LID - 817
AB  - Pelvic exenteration represents a radical procedure aimed at achieving complete 
      tumor resection with negative margins. Although it is the only therapeutic option 
      for some cases of advanced tumors, it is associated with several perioperative 
      complications. We believe that careful patient selection is related to better 
      oncologic outcomes and lower complication rates. The objectives of this review 
      are to identify the most current indications for this intervention, suggest 
      criteria for case selection, evaluate recommendations for perioperative care, and 
      review oncologic outcomes and potential associated complications. To this end, an 
      analysis of English language articles in PubMed was performed, searching for 
      topics such as the indication for pelvic exenteration for recurrent gynecologic 
      neoplasms selection of oncologic cases, the impact of tumor size and extent on 
      oncologic outcomes, preoperative and postoperative surgical management, surgical 
      complications, and outcomes of overall survival and recurrence-free survival.

TI  - Use of artificial intelligence in the field of pain medicine.
PG  - 236-239
LID - 10.12998/wjcc.v12.i2.236 [doi]
AB  - In this editorial we comment on the article "Potential and limitations of ChatGPT 
      and generative artificial intelligence in medial safety education" published in 
      the recent issue of the World Journal of Clinical Cases. This article described 
      the usefulness of artificial intelligence (AI) in medial safety education. 
      Herein, we focus specifically on the use of AI in the field of pain medicine. AI 
      technology has emerged as a powerful tool, and is expected to play an important 
      role in the healthcare sector and significantly contribute to pain medicine as 
      further developments are made. AI may have several applications in pain medicine. 
      First, AI can assist in selecting testing methods to identify causes of pain and 
      improve diagnostic accuracy. Entry of a patient's symptoms into the algorithm can 
      prompt it to suggest necessary tests and possible diagnoses. Based on the latest 
      medical information and recent research results, AI can support doctors in making 
      accurate diagnoses and setting up an effective treatment plan. Second, AI assists 
      in interpreting medical images. For neural and musculoskeletal disorders, imaging 
      tests are of vital importance. AI can analyze a variety of imaging data, 
      including that from radiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance 
      imaging, to identify specific patterns, allowing quick and accurate image 
      interpretation. Third, AI can predict the outcomes of pain treatments, 
      contributing to setting up the optimal treatment plan. By predicting individual 
      patient responses to treatment, AI algorithms can assist doctors in establishing 
      a treatment plan tailored to each patient, further enhancing treatment 
      effectiveness. For efficient utilization of AI in the pain medicine field, it is 
      crucial to enhance the accuracy of AI decision-making by using more medical data, 
      while issues related to the protection of patient personal information and 
      responsibility for AI decisions will have to be addressed. In the future, AI 
      technology is expected to be innovatively applied in the field of pain medicine. 
      The advancement of AI is anticipated to have a positive impact on the entire 
      medical field by providing patients with accurate and effective medical services.

TI  - Chatbot responses suggest that hypothetical biology questions are harder than 
      realistic ones.
LID - 10.1128/jmbe.00153-23 [doi]
LID - e00153-23
AB  - The biology education literature includes compelling assertions that unfamiliar 
      problems are especially useful for revealing students' true understanding of 
      biology. However, there is only limited evidence that such novel problems have 
      different cognitive requirements than more familiar problems. Here, we sought 
      additional evidence by using chatbots based on large language models as models of 
      biology students. For human physiology and cell biology, we developed sets of 
      realistic and hypothetical problems matched to the same lesson learning 
      objectives (LLOs). Problems were considered hypothetical if (i) known biological 
      entities (molecules and organs) were given atypical or counterfactual properties 
      (redefinition) or (ii) fictitious biological entities were introduced 
      (invention). Several chatbots scored significantly worse on hypothetical problems 
      than on realistic problems, with scores declining by an average of 13%. Among 
      hypothetical questions, redefinition questions appeared especially difficult, 
      with many chatbots scoring as if guessing randomly. These results suggest that, 
      for a given LLO, hypothetical problems may have different cognitive demands than 
      realistic problems and may more accurately reveal students' ability to apply 
      biology core concepts to diverse contexts. The Test Question Templates (TQT) 
      framework, which explicitly connects LLOs with examples of assessment questions, 
      can help educators generate problems that are challenging (due to their novelty), 
      yet fair (due to their alignment with pre-specified LLOs). Finally, ChatGPT's 
      rapid improvement toward expert-level answers suggests that future educators 
      cannot reasonably expect to ignore or outwit chatbots but must do what we can to 
      make assessments fair and equitable.

PG  - e48078
LID - 10.7759/cureus.48078 [doi]
LID - e48078
AB  - This literature review sought to identify and evaluate the current applications 
      of artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) in spine surgery that can 
      effectively guide clinical decision-making and surgical planning. By using 
      specific keywords to maximize search sensitivity, a thorough literature research 
      was conducted in several online databases: Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar, 
      and the findings were filtered according to the Preferred Reporting Items for 
      Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 46 studies 
      met the requirements and were included in this review. According to this study, 
      AI/ML models were sufficiently accurate with a mean overall value of 74.9%, and 
      performed best at preoperative patient selection, cost prediction, and length of 
      stay. Performance was also good at predicting functional outcomes and 
      postoperative mortality. Regression analysis was the most frequently utilized 
      application whereas deep learning/artificial neural networks had the highest 
      sensitivity score (81.5%). Despite the relatively brief history of engagement 
      with AI/ML, as evidenced by the fact that 77.5% of studies were published after 
      2018, the outcomes have been promising. In light of the Big Data era, the 
      increasing prevalence of National Registries, and the wide-ranging applications 
      of AI, such as exemplified by ChatGPT (OpenAI, San Francisco, California), it is 
      highly likely that the field of spine surgery will gradually adopt and integrate 
      AI/ML into its clinical practices. Consequently, it is of great significance for 
      spine surgeons to acquaint themselves with the fundamental principles of AI/ML, 
      as these technologies hold the potential for substantial improvements in overall 
      patient care.

AB  - Over 80&nbsp;% of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) experience osteolytic bone 
      lesions, primarily due to an imbalanced interaction between osteoclasts and 
      osteoblasts. This imbalance can lead to several adverse outcomes such as pain, 
      fractures, limited mobility, and neurological impairments. Myeloma bone disease 
      (MBD) raises the expense of management in addition to being a major source of 
      disability and morbidity in myeloma patients. Whole-body x-ray radiography was 
      the gold standard imaging modality for detecting lytic lesions. Osteolytic 
      lesions are difficult to identify at an earlier stage on X-ray since the lesions 
      do not manifest themselves on conventional radiographs until at least 30&nbsp;% to 
      50&nbsp;% of the bone mass has been destroyed. Hence, early diagnosis of osteolytic 
      lesions necessitates the utilization of more complex and advanced imaging 
      modalities, such as PET. One of the PET radiotracers that has been frequently 
      investigated in MM is (18)F-FDG, which has demonstrated a high level of 
      sensitivity and specificity in detecting myeloma lesions. However, (18)F-FDG 
      PET/CT has several restrictions, and therefore the novel PET tracers that can 
      overcome the limitations of (18)F-FDG PET/CT should be further examined in 
      assessment of MBD. The objective of this review article is to thoroughly examine 
      the significance of both conventional and novel PET radiotracers in the 
      assessment of MBD. The intention is to present the information in a manner that 
      would be easily understood by healthcare professionals from diverse backgrounds, 
      while minimizing the use of complex nuclear medicine terminology.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Scientific writing in English is a daunting task for non-native 
      English speakers. The challenges of writing in a foreign language are evident in 
      the scientific literature where texts by non-native English-speaking scientists 
      tend to be less clear and succinct, contain grammatical errors, and are often 
      rejected by prestigious journals. METHODS: We conducted a non-systematic review 
      of the most recent literature using the terms "Artificial Intelligence," 
      "Scientific Writing," and "Non-English Speaking" to create a narrative review. 
      RESULTS: Artificial intelligence can be a solution to improve scientific writing, 
      especially for non-native English-speaking scientists. Artificial intelligence 
      can assist in the search for pertinent scientific papers, generate summaries, and 
      help with the writing of different sections of the manuscript, including the 
      abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion. Artificial 
      intelligence-based programs can correct grammatical errors and improve writing 
      style, both of which are particularly helpful for non-native English speakers. 
      Two artificial intelligence programs that can help with the search for pertinent 
      scientific papers on the internet are Elicit and ResearchRabbit. Scispace Copilot 
      can be used to summarize the retrieved reference. The artificial intelligence 
      software programs such as Grammarly and Paperpal can correct grammatical and 
      spelling errors, while ChatGPT can also restructure sentences and paragraphs, 
      reword text, and suggest appropriate words and phrases. CONCLUSION: Overall, 
      artificial intelligence can be an effective tool to improve the clarity, style, 
      and coherence of scientific writing, helping non-native English-speaking 
      scientists to communicate their research more effectively.

AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: With recent advancements in the power and accessibility 
      of artificial intelligence (AI) Large Language Models (LLMs) patients might 
      increasingly turn to these platforms to answer questions regarding radiologic 
      examinations and procedures, despite valid concerns about the accuracy of 
      information provided. This study aimed to assess the accuracy and completeness of 
      information provided by the Bing Chatbot-a LLM powered by ChatGPT-on patient 
      education for common radiologic exams. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We selected three 
      common radiologic examinations and procedures: computed tomography (CT) abdomen, 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) spine, and bone biopsy. For each, ten questions 
      were tested on the chatbot in two trials using three different chatbot settings. 
      Two reviewers independently assessed the chatbot's responses for accuracy and 
      completeness compared to an accepted online resource, radiologyinfo.org. RESULTS: 
      Of the 360 reviews performed, 336 (93%) were rated "entirely correct" and 24 (7%) 
      were "mostly correct," indicating a high level of reliability. Completeness 
      ratings showed that 65% were "complete" and 35% were "mostly complete." The "More 
      Creative" chatbot setting produced a higher proportion of responses rated 
      "entirely correct" but there were otherwise no significant difference in ratings 
      based on chatbot settings or exam types. The readability level was rated 
      eighth-grade level. CONCLUSION: The Bing Chatbot provided accurate responses 
      answering all or most aspects of the question asked of it, with responses tending 
      to err on the side of caution for nuanced questions. Importantly, no responses 
      were inaccurate or had potential to cause harm or confusion for the user. Thus, 
      LLM chatbots demonstrate potential to enhance patient education in radiology and 
      could be integrated into patient portals for various purposes, including exam 
      preparation and results interpretation.

TI  - Machine Learning in Pediatrics: Evaluating Challenges, Opportunities, and 
      Explainability.
LID - S097475591600533 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT 
      and Bard is disrupting a broad swathe of fields, including medicine. In pediatric 
      medicine, AI is also increasingly being used across multiple subspecialties. 
      However, the practical application of AI still faces a number of key challenges. 
      Consequently, there is a requirement for a concise overview of the roles of AI 
      across the multiple domains of pediatric medicine that the current study seeks to 
      address. AIM: To systematically assess the challenges, opportunities, and 
      explainability of AI in pediatric medicine. METHODOLOGY: A systematic search was 
      carried out on peer-reviewed databases, PubMed Central, Europe PubMed Central, 
      and grey literature using search terms related to machine learning (ML) and AI 
      for the years 2016 to 2022 in the English language. A total of 210 articles were 
      retrieved that were screened with PRISMA for abstract, year, language, context, 
      and proximal relevance to research aims. A thematic analysis was carried out to 
      extract findings from the included studies. RESULTS: Twenty articles were 
      selected for data abstraction and analysis, with three consistent themes emerging 
      from these articles. In particular, eleven articles address the current 
      state-of-the-art application of AI in diagnosing and predicting health conditions 
      such as behavioral and mental health, cancer, syndromic and metabolic diseases. 
      Five articles highlight the specific challenges of AI deployment in pediatric 
      medicines: data security, handling, authentication, and validation. Four articles 
      set out future opportunities for AI to be adapted: the incorporation of Big Data, 
      cloud computing, precision medicine, and clinical decision support systems. These 
      studies collectively critically evaluate the potential of AI in overcoming 
      current barriers to adoption. CONCLUSION: AI is proving disruptive within 
      pediatric medicine and is presently associated with challenges, opportunities, 
      and the need for explainability. AI should be viewed as a tool to enhance and 
      support clinical decision-making rather than a substitute for human judgement and 
      expertise. Future research should consequently focus on obtaining comprehensive 
      data to ensure the generalizability of research findings.

TI  - Performance of GPT-4 Vision on kidney pathology exam questions.
LID - aqae030 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ajcp/aqae030 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: ChatGPT (OpenAI, San Francisco, CA) has shown impressive results 
      across various medical examinations, but its performance in kidney pathology is 
      not yet established. This study evaluated proficiencies of GPT-4 Vision (GPT-4V), 
      an updated version of the platform with the ability to analyze images, on kidney 
      pathology questions and compared its responses with those of nephrology trainees. 
      METHODS: Thirty-nine questions (19 text-based questions and 20 with various 
      kidney biopsy images) designed specifically for the training of nephrology 
      fellows were employed. RESULTS: GPT-4V displayed comparable accuracy rates in the 
      first and second runs (67% and 72%, respectively, Pâ=â.50). The aggregated 
      accuracy, however-particularly, the consistent accuracy-of GPT-4V was lower than 
      that of trainees (72% and 67% vs 79%). Both GPT-4V and trainees displayed 
      comparable accuracy in responding to image-based and text-only questions (55% vs 
      79% and 81% vs 78%, Pâ=â.11 and Pâ=â.67, respectively). The consistent accuracy 
      in image-based, directly asked questions for GPT-4V was 29%, much lower than its 
      88% consistency on text-only, directly asked questions (Pâ=â.02). In contrast, 
      trainees maintained similar accuracy in directly asked image-based and text-based 
      questions (80% vs 77%, Pâ=â.65). Although the aggregated accuracy for correctly 
      interpreting images was 69%, the consistent accuracy across both runs was only 
      39%. The accuracy of GPT-4V in answering questions with correct image 
      interpretation was significantly higher than for questions with incorrect image 
      interpretation (100% vs 0% and 100% vs 33% for the first and second runs, 
      Pâ=â.001 and Pâ=â.02, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The performance of GPT-4V in 
      handling kidney pathology questions, especially those including images, is 
      limited. There is a notable need for enhancement in GPT-4V proficiency in 
      interpreting images.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: SARS-CoV-2 drove the catastrophic global phenomenon of the 
      COVID-19 pandemic resulting in a multitude of systemic health issues, including 
      bone loss. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent findings related to 
      bone loss and potential mechanisms. RECENT FINDINGS: The early clinical evidence 
      indicates an increase in vertebral fractures, hypocalcemia, vitamin D 
      deficiencies, and a loss in BMD among COVID-19 patients. Additionally, lower BMD 
      is associated with more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Preclinical models have 
      shown bone loss and increased osteoclastogenesis. The bone loss associated with 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection could be the result of many factors that directly affect the 
      bone such as higher inflammation, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, 
      recruitment of Th17 cells, the hypoxic environment, and changes in RANKL/OPG 
      signaling. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 infection can exert indirect effects on the 
      skeleton, as mechanical unloading may occur with severe disease (e.g., bed rest) 
      or with BMI loss and muscle wasting that has also been shown to occur with 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. Muscle wasting can also cause systemic issues that may 
      influence the bone. Medications used to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection also have a 
      negative effect on the bone. Lastly, SARS-CoV-2 infection may also worsen 
      conditions such as diabetes and negatively affect kidney function, all of which 
      could contribute to bone loss and increased fracture risk. SARS-CoV-2 can 
      negatively affect the bone through multiple direct and indirect mechanisms. 
      Future work will be needed to determine what patient populations are at risk of 
      COVID-19-related increases in fracture risk, the mechanisms behind bone loss, and 
      therapeutic options.&nbsp;This review article is part of a series of multiple 
      manuscripts designed to determine the utility of using artificial intelligence 
      for writing scientific reviews.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates an AI assistant developed using OpenAI's GPT-4 
      for interpreting pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing results, aiming to improve 
      decision-making and knowledge sharing in clinical genetics and to enhance patient 
      care with equitable access. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The AI assistant employs 
      retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which combines retrieval and generative 
      techniques, by harnessing a knowledge base (KB) that comprises data from the 
      Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC). It uses context-aware 
      GPT-4 to generate tailored responses to user queries from this KB, further 
      refined through prompt engineering and guardrails. RESULTS: Evaluated against a 
      specialized PGx question catalog, the AI assistant showed high efficacy in 
      addressing user queries. Compared with OpenAI's ChatGPT 3.5, it demonstrated 
      better performance, especially in provider-specific queries requiring specialized 
      data and citations. Key areas for improvement include enhancing accuracy, 
      relevancy, and representative language in responses. DISCUSSION: The integration 
      of context-aware GPT-4 with RAG significantly enhanced the AI assistant's 
      utility. RAG's ability to incorporate domain-specific CPIC data, including recent 
      literature, proved beneficial. Challenges persist, such as the need for 
      specialized genetic/PGx models to improve accuracy and relevancy and addressing 
      ethical, regulatory, and safety concerns. CONCLUSION: This study underscores 
      generative AI's potential for transforming healthcare provider support and 
      patient accessibility to complex pharmacogenomic information. While careful 
      implementation of large language models like GPT-4 is necessary, it is clear that 
      they can substantially improve understanding of pharmacogenomic data. With 
      further development, these tools could augment healthcare expertise, provider 
      productivity, and the delivery of equitable, patient-centered healthcare 
      services.

AB  - The importance of written communication between clinicians and patients, 
      especially in the wake of the Supreme Court case of Montgomery vs Lanarkshire, 
      has led to a shift toward patient-centric care in the United Kingdom. This study 
      investigates the use of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Google Bard 
      in enhancing clinic letters with gold-standard complication profiles, aiming to 
      improve patients' understanding and save clinicians' time in aesthetic plastic 
      surgery. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of LLMs in 
      integrating complication profiles from authoritative sources into clinic letters, 
      thus enhancing patient comprehension and clinician efficiency in aesthetic 
      plastic surgery. Seven widely performed aesthetic procedures were chosen, and 
      complication profiles were sourced from the British Association of Aesthetic 
      Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) and the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS). We 
      evaluated the proficiency of the ChatGPT4, ChatGPT3.5, and Google Bard in 
      generating clinic letters which incorporated complication profiles from online 
      resources. These letters were assessed for readability using an online tool, 
      targeting a recommended sixth-grade reading level. ChatGPT4 achieved the highest 
      compliance in integrating complication profiles from BAAPS and ASPS websites, 
      with average readability grades between eighth and ninth. ChatGPT3.5 and Google 
      Bard showed lower compliance, particularly when accessing paywalled content like 
      the ASPS Informed Consent Bundle. In conclusion, LLMs, particularly ChatGPT4, 
      show promise in enhancing patient communications in aesthetic plastic surgery by 
      effectively incorporating standard complication profiles into clinic letters. 
      This aids in informed decision making and time saving for clinicians. However, 
      the study underscores the need for improvements in data accessibility, search 
      capabilities, and ethical considerations for optimal LLM integration into 
      healthcare communications. Future enhancements should focus on better 
      interpretation of inaccessible formats and a Human in the Loop approach to 
      combine Artifical Intelligence capabilities with clinician expertise.

TI  - Comprehensive microbiome causal mediation analysis using MiMed on user-friendly 
      web interfaces.
PG  - bpad023
LID - 10.1093/biomethods/bpad023 [doi]
LID - bpad023
AB  - It is a central goal of human microbiome studies to see the roles of the 
      microbiome as a mediator that transmits environmental, behavioral, or medical 
      exposures to health or disease outcomes. Yet, mediation analysis is not used as 
      much as it should be. One reason is because of the lack of carefully planned 
      routines, compilers, and automated computing systems for microbiome mediation 
      analysis (MiMed) to perform a series of data processing, diversity calculation, 
      data normalization, downstream data analysis, and visualizations. Many 
      researchers in various disciplines (e.g. clinicians, public health practitioners, 
      and biologists) are not also familiar with related statistical methods and 
      programming languages on command-line interfaces. Thus, in this article, we 
      introduce a web cloud computing platform, named as MiMed, that enables 
      comprehensive MiMed on user-friendly web interfaces. The main features of MiMed 
      are as follows. First, MiMed can survey the microbiome in various spheres (i) as 
      a whole microbial ecosystem using different ecological measures (e.g. alpha- and 
      beta-diversity indices) or (ii) as individual microbial taxa (e.g. phyla, 
      classes, orders, families, genera, and species) using different data 
      normalization methods. Second, MiMed enables covariate-adjusted analysis to 
      control for potential confounding factors (e.g. age and gender), which is 
      essential to enhance the causality of the results, especially for observational 
      studies. Third, MiMed enables a breadth of statistical inferences in both 
      mediation effect estimation and significance testing. Fourth, MiMed provides 
      flexible and easy-to-use data processing and analytic modules and creates nice 
      graphical representations. Finally, MiMed employs ChatGPT to search for what has 
      been known about the microbial taxa that are found significantly as mediators 
      using artificial intelligence technologies. For demonstration purposes, we 
      applied MiMed to the study on the mediating roles of oral microbiome in 
      subgingival niches between e-cigarette smoking and gingival inflammation. MiMed 
      is freely available on our web server (http://mimed.micloud.kr).

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning are the current forefront of 
      computer science and technology. AI and related sub-disciplines, including 
      machine learning, are essential technologies which have enabled the widespread 
      use of smart technology, such as smart phones, smart home appliances and even 
      electric toothbrushes. It is AI that allows the devices used day-to-day across 
      people's personal lives, working lives and in industry to better anticipate and 
      respond to our needs. However, the use of AI technology comes with a range of 
      ethical questions - including issues around privacy, security, reliability, 
      copyright/plagiarism and whether AI is capable of independent, conscious thought. 
      We have seen several issues related to racial and sexual bias in AI in the recent 
      times, putting the reliability of AI in question. Many of these issues have been 
      brought to the forefront of cultural awareness in late 2022, early 2023, with the 
      rise of AI art programs (and the copyright issues arising from the deep-learning 
      methods employed to train this AI), and the popularity of ChatGPT alongside its 
      ability to be used to mimic human output, particularly in regard to academic 
      work. In critical areas like healthcare, the errors of AI can be fatal. With the 
      incorporation of AI in almost every sector of our everyday life, we need to keep 
      asking ourselves- can we trust AI, and how much? This Editorial outlines the 
      importance of openness and transparency in the development and applications of AI 
      to allow all users to fully understand both the benefits and risks of this 
      ubiquitous technology, and outlines how the Artificial Intelligence and Machine 
      Learning &nbsp;Gateway on F1000Research meets these needs.

TI  - Body size as a metric for the affordable world.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.90583 [doi]
LID - RP90583
AB  - The physical body of an organism serves as a vital interface for interactions 
      with its environment. Here, we investigated the impact of human body size on the 
      perception of action possibilities (affordances) offered by the environment. We 
      found that the body size delineated a distinct boundary on affordances, dividing 
      objects of continuous real-world sizes into two discrete categories with each 
      affording distinct action sets. Additionally, the boundary shifted with imagined 
      body sizes, suggesting a causal link between body size and affordance perception. 
      Intriguingly, ChatGPT, a large language model lacking physical embodiment, 
      exhibited a modest yet comparable affordance boundary at the scale of human body 
      size, suggesting the boundary is not exclusively derived from 
      organism-environment interactions. A subsequent fMRI experiment offered 
      preliminary evidence of affordance processing exclusively for objects within the 
      body size range, but not for those beyond. This suggests that only objects 
      capable of being manipulated are the objects capable of offering affordance in 
      the eyes of an organism. In summary, our study suggests a novel definition of 
      object-ness in an affordance-based context, advocating the concept of embodied 
      cognition in understanding the emergence of intelligence constrained by an 
      organism's physical attributes.

TI  - Comparing Artificial Intelligence and Senior Residents in Oral Lesion Diagnosis: 
      A Comparative Study.
PG  - e51584
LID - 10.7759/cureus.51584 [doi]
LID - e51584
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that 
      seeks to build intelligent machines that can carry out tasks that usually 
      necessitate human intelligence. AI may help dentists with a variety of dental 
      tasks, including clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. This study aims to 
      compare the performance of AI and oral medicine residents in diagnosing different 
      cases, providing treatment, and determining if it is reliable to assist them in 
      their field of work. METHODS: The study conducted a comparative analysis of the 
      responses from third- and fourth-year residents trained in Oral Medicine and 
      Pathology at King Saud University, College of Dentistry. The residents were given 
      a closed multiple-choice test consisting of 19 questions with four response 
      options labeled A-D and one question with five response options labeled A-E. The 
      test was administered via Google Forms, and each resident's response was stored 
      electronically in an Excel sheet (MicrosoftÂ® Corp., Redmond, WA). The residents' 
      answers were then compared to the responses generated by three major language 
      models: OpenAI, Stablediffusion, and PopAI. The questions were inputted into the 
      language models in the same format as the original test, and prior to each 
      question, an artificial intelligence chat session was created to eliminate memory 
      retention bias. The input was done on November 19, 2023, the same day the 
      official multiple-choice test was administered. The study had a sample size of 20 
      residents trained in Oral Medicine and Pathology at King Saud University, College 
      of Dentistry, consisting of both third-year and fourth-year residents. RESULT: 
      The responses of three large language models (LLM), including OpenAI, 
      Stablediffusion, and PopAI, as well as the responses of 20 senior residents for 
      20 clinical cases about oral lesion diagnosis. There were no significant 
      variations observed for the remaining questions in the responses to only two 
      questions (10%). For the remaining questions, there were no significant 
      differences. The median (IQR) score of LLMs was 50.0 (45.0 to 60.0), with a 
      minimum of 40 (for stable diffusion) and a maximum of 70 (for OpenAI). The median 
      (IQR) score of senior residents was 65.0 (55.0-75.0). The highest and lowest 
      scores of residents were 40 and 90, respectively. There was no significant 
      difference in the percent scores of residents and LLMs (p = 0.211). The agreement 
      level was measured using the Kappa value. The agreement among senior dental 
      residents was observed to be weak, with a Kappa value of 0.396. In contrast, the 
      agreement among LLMs demonstrated a moderate level, with a Kappa value of 0.622, 
      suggesting a more cohesive alignment in responses among the artificial 
      intelligence models. When comparing residents' responses with those generated by 
      different OpenAI models, including OpenAI, Stablediffusion, and PopAI, the 
      agreement levels were consistently categorized as weak, with Kappa values of 
      0.402, 0.381, and 0.392, respectively. CONCLUSION: What the current study reveals 
      is that when comparing the response score, there is no significant difference, in 
      contrast to the agreement analysis among the residents, which was low compared to 
      the LLMs, in which it was high. Dentists should consider that AI is very 
      beneficial in providing diagnosis and treatment and use it to assist them.

TI  - Large Language Models for Therapy Recommendations Across 3 Clinical Specialties: 
      Comparative Study.
PG  - e49324
LID - 10.2196/49324 [doi]
LID - e49324
AB  - BACKGROUND: As advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) continue, large 
      language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for generating medical 
      information. Their rapid adaptation and potential benefits in health care require 
      rigorous assessment in terms of the quality, accuracy, and safety of the 
      generated information across diverse medical specialties. OBJECTIVE: This study 
      aimed to evaluate the performance of 4 prominent LLMs, namely, 
      Claude-instant-v1.0, GPT-3.5-Turbo, Command-xlarge-nightly, and Bloomz, in 
      generating medical content spanning the clinical specialties of ophthalmology, 
      orthopedics, and dermatology. METHODS: Three domain-specific physicians evaluated 
      the AI-generated therapeutic recommendations for a diverse set of 60 diseases. 
      The evaluation criteria involved the mDISCERN score, correctness, and potential 
      harmfulness of the recommendations. ANOVA and pairwise t tests were used to 
      explore discrepancies in content quality and safety across models and 
      specialties. Additionally, using the capabilities of OpenAI's most advanced 
      model, GPT-4, an automated evaluation of each model's responses to the diseases 
      was performed using the same criteria and compared to the physicians' assessments 
      through Pearson correlation analysis. RESULTS: Claude-instant-v1.0 emerged with 
      the highest mean mDISCERN score (3.35, 95% CI 3.23-3.46). In contrast, Bloomz 
      lagged with the lowest score (1.07, 95% CI 1.03-1.10). Our analysis revealed 
      significant differences among the models in terms of quality (P&lt;.001). Evaluating 
      their reliability, the models displayed strong contrasts in their falseness 
      ratings, with variations both across models (P&lt;.001) and specialties (P&lt;.001). 
      Distinct error patterns emerged, such as confusing diagnoses; providing vague, 
      ambiguous advice; or omitting critical treatments, such as antibiotics for 
      infectious diseases. Regarding potential harm, GPT-3.5-Turbo was found to be the 
      safest, with the lowest harmfulness rating. All models lagged in detailing the 
      risks associated with treatment procedures, explaining the effects of therapies 
      on quality of life, and offering additional sources of information. Pearson 
      correlation analysis underscored a substantial alignment between physician 
      assessments and GPT-4's evaluations across all established criteria (P&lt;.01). 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study, while comprehensive, was limited by the involvement of a 
      select number of specialties and physician evaluators. The straightforward 
      prompting strategy ("How to treatâ¦") and the assessment benchmarks, initially 
      conceptualized for human-authored content, might have potential gaps in capturing 
      the nuances of AI-driven information. The LLMs evaluated showed a notable 
      capability in generating valuable medical content; however, evident lapses in 
      content quality and potential harm signal the need for further refinements. Given 
      the dynamic landscape of LLMs, this study's findings emphasize the need for 
      regular and methodical assessments, oversight, and fine-tuning of these AI tools 
      to ensure they produce consistently trustworthy and clinically safe medical 
      advice. Notably, the introduction of an auto-evaluation mechanism using GPT-4, as 
      detailed in this study, provides a scalable, transferable method for 
      domain-agnostic evaluations, extending beyond therapy recommendation assessments.

TI  - A Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT)-Powered Chatbot as a Simulated Patient 
      to Practice History Taking: Prospective, Mixed Methods Study.
PG  - e53961
LID - 10.2196/53961 [doi]
LID - e53961
AB  - BACKGROUND: Communication is a core competency of medical professionals and of 
      utmost importance for patient safety. Although medical curricula emphasize 
      communication training, traditional formats, such as real or simulated patient 
      interactions, can present psychological stress and are limited in repetition. The 
      recent emergence of large language models (LLMs), such as generative pretrained 
      transformer (GPT), offers an opportunity to overcome these restrictions. 
      OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of a GPT-driven 
      chatbot to practice history taking, one of the core competencies of 
      communication. METHODS: We developed an interactive chatbot interface using 
      GPT-3.5 and a specific prompt including a chatbot-optimized illness script and a 
      behavioral component. Following a mixed methods approach, we invited medical 
      students to voluntarily practice history taking. To determine whether GPT 
      provides suitable answers as a simulated patient, the conversations were recorded 
      and analyzed using quantitative and qualitative approaches. We analyzed the 
      extent to which the questions and answers aligned with the provided script, as 
      well as the medical plausibility of the answers. Finally, the students filled out 
      the Chatbot Usability Questionnaire (CUQ). RESULTS: A total of 28 students 
      practiced with our chatbot (mean age 23.4, SD 2.9 years). We recorded a total of 
      826 question-answer pairs (QAPs), with a median of 27.5 QAPs per conversation and 
      94.7% (n=782) pertaining to history taking. When questions were explicitly 
      covered by the script (n=502, 60.3%), the GPT-provided answers were mostly based 
      on explicit script information (n=471, 94.4%). For questions not covered by the 
      script (n=195, 23.4%), the GPT answers used 56.4% (n=110) fictitious information. 
      Regarding plausibility, 842 (97.9%) of 860 QAPs were rated as plausible. Of the 
      14 (2.1%) implausible answers, GPT provided answers rated as socially desirable, 
      leaving role identity, ignoring script information, illogical reasoning, and 
      calculation error. Despite these results, the CUQ revealed an overall positive 
      user experience (77/100 points). CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed that LLMs, such as 
      GPT, can provide a simulated patient experience and yield a good user experience 
      and a majority of plausible answers. Our analysis revealed that GPT-provided 
      answers use either explicit script information or are based on available 
      information, which can be understood as abductive reasoning. Although rare, the 
      GPT-based chatbot provides implausible information in some instances, with the 
      major tendency being socially desirable instead of medically plausible 
      information.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The rapid trajectory of artificial intelligence (AI) development and 
      advancement is quickly outpacing society's ability to determine its future role. 
      As AI continues to transform various aspects of our lives, one critical question 
      arises for medical education: what will be the nature of education, teaching, and 
      learning in a future world where the acquisition, retention, and application of 
      knowledge in the traditional sense are fundamentally altered by AI? OBJECTIVE: 
      The purpose of this perspective is to plan for the intersection of health care 
      and medical education in the future. METHODS: We used GPT-4 and scenario-based 
      strategic planning techniques to craft 4 hypothetical future worlds influenced by 
      AI's integration into health care and medical education. This method, used by 
      organizations such as Shell and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical 
      Education, assesses readiness for alternative futures and effectively manages 
      uncertainty, risk, and opportunity. The detailed scenarios provide insights into 
      potential environments the medical profession may face and lay the foundation for 
      hypothesis generation and idea-building regarding responsible AI implementation. 
      RESULTS: The following 4 worlds were created using OpenAI's GPT model: AI 
      Harmony, AI conflict, The world of Ecological Balance, and Existential Risk. 
      Risks include disinformation and misinformation, loss of privacy, widening 
      inequity, erosion of human autonomy, and ethical dilemmas. Benefits involve 
      improved efficiency, personalized interventions, enhanced collaboration, early 
      detection, and accelerated research. CONCLUSIONS: To ensure responsible AI use, 
      the authors suggest focusing on 3 key areas: developing a robust ethical 
      framework, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, and investing in education 
      and training. A strong ethical framework emphasizes patient safety, privacy, and 
      autonomy while promoting equity and inclusivity. Interdisciplinary collaboration 
      encourages cooperation among various experts in developing and implementing AI 
      technologies, ensuring that they address the complex needs and challenges in 
      health care and medical education. Investing in education and training prepares 
      professionals and trainees with necessary skills and knowledge to effectively use 
      and critically evaluate AI technologies. The integration of AI in health care and 
      medical education presents a critical juncture between transformative 
      advancements and significant risks. By working together to address both immediate 
      and long-term risks and consequences, we can ensure that AI integration leads to 
      a more equitable, sustainable, and prosperous future for both health care and 
      medical education. As we engage with AI technologies, our collective actions will 
      ultimately determine the state of the future of health care and medical education 
      to harness AI's power while ensuring the safety and well-being of humanity.

TI  - A practical guide to the development and deployment of deep learning models for 
      the orthopaedic surgeon: Part III, focus on registry creation, diagnosis,&nbsp;and 
      data privacy.
PG  - 518-528
LID - 10.1002/ksa.12085 [doi]
AB  - Deep learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) with enormous potential 
      to transform orthopaedic surgery. As has already become evident with the 
      deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT (OpenAI Inc.), deep 
      learning can rapidly enter clinical and surgical practices. As such, it is 
      imperative that orthopaedic surgeons acquire a deeper understanding of the 
      technical terminology, capabilities&nbsp;and limitations associated with deep learning 
      models. The focus of this series thus far has been providing surgeons with an 
      overview of the steps needed to implement a deep learning-based pipeline, 
      emphasizing some of the important technical details for surgeons to understand as 
      they encounter, evaluate&nbsp;or lead deep learning projects. However, this series 
      would be remiss without providing practical examples of how deep learning models 
      have begun to be deployed and highlighting the areas where the authors feel deep 
      learning may have the most profound potential. While computer vision applications 
      of deep learning were the focus of Parts I and II, due to the enormous impact 
      that natural language processing (NLP) has had in recent months, NLP-based deep 
      learning models are also discussed in this final part of the series. In this 
      review, three applications that the authors believe can be impacted the most by 
      deep learning but with which many surgeons may not be familiar are discussed: (1) 
      registry construction, (2) diagnostic AI&nbsp;and (3) data privacy. Deep 
      learning-based registry construction will be essential for the development of 
      more impactful clinical applications, with diagnostic AI being one of those 
      applications likely to augment clinical decision-making in the near future. As 
      the applications of deep learning continue to grow, the protection of patient 
      information will become increasingly essential; as such, applications of deep 
      learning to enhance data privacy are likely to become more important than ever 
      before. Level of Evidence: Level IV.

TI  - An introduction to machine learning and generative artificial intelligence&nbsp;for 
      otolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons: a narrative review.
LID - 10.1007/s00405-024-08512-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Despite the robust expansion of research surrounding artificial 
      intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) and their applications to medicine, 
      these methodologies often remain opaque and inaccessible to many 
      otolaryngologists. Especially, with the increasing ubiquity of large-language 
      models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and their potential implementation in clinical 
      practice, clinicians may benefit from a baseline understanding of some aspects of 
      AI. In this narrative review, we seek to clarify underlying concepts, illustrate 
      applications to otolaryngology, and highlight future directions and limitations 
      of these tools. METHODS: Recent literature regarding AI principles and 
      otolaryngologic applications of ML and LLMs was reviewed via search in PubMed and 
      Google Scholar. RESULTS: Significant recent strides have been made in 
      otolaryngology research utilizing AI and ML, across all subspecialties, including 
      neurotology, head and neck oncology, laryngology, rhinology, and sleep surgery. 
      Potential applications suggested by recent publications include screening and 
      diagnosis, predictive tools, clinical decision support, and clinical workflow 
      improvement via LLMs. Ongoing concerns regarding AI in medicine include ethical 
      concerns around bias and data sharing, as well as the "black box" problem and 
      limitations in explainability. CONCLUSIONS: Potential implementations of AI in 
      otolaryngology are rapidly expanding. While implementation in clinical practice 
      remains theoretical for most of these tools, their potential power to influence 
      the practice of otolaryngology is substantial.

TI  - A Comprehensive Evaluation of Large Language Models in Mining Gene Interactions 
      and Pathway Knowledge.
LID - 2024.01.21.576542 [pii]
LID - 10.1101/2024.01.21.576542 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding complex biological pathways, including gene-gene 
      interactions and gene regulatory networks, is critical for exploring disease 
      mechanisms and drug development. Manual literature curation of biological 
      pathways is useful but cannot keep up with the exponential growth of the 
      literature. Large-scale language models (LLMs), notable for their vast parameter 
      sizes and comprehensive training on extensive text corpora, have great potential 
      in automated text mining of biological pathways. METHOD: This study assesses the 
      effectiveness of 21 LLMs, including both API-based models and open-source models. 
      The evaluation focused on two key aspects: gene regulatory relations 
      (specifically, 'activation', 'inhibition', and 'phosphorylation') and KEGG 
      pathway component recognition. The performance of these models was analyzed using 
      statistical metrics such as precision, recall, F1 scores, and the Jaccard 
      similarity index. RESULTS: Our results indicated a significant disparity in model 
      performance. Among the API-based models, ChatGPT-4 and Claude-Pro showed superior 
      performance, with an F1 score of 0.4448 and 0.4386 for the gene regulatory 
      relation prediction, and a Jaccard similarity index of 0.2778 and 0.2657 for the 
      KEGG pathway prediction, respectively. Open-source models lagged their API-based 
      counterparts, where Falcon-180b-chat and llama1-7b led with the highest 
      performance in gene regulatory relations (F1 of 0.2787 and 0.1923, respectively) 
      and KEGG pathway recognition (Jaccard similarity index of 0.2237 and 0. 2207, 
      respectively). CONCLUSION: LLMs are valuable in biomedical research, especially 
      in gene network analysis and pathway mapping. However, their effectiveness 
      varies, necessitating careful model selection. This work also provided a case 
      study and insight into using LLMs as knowledge graphs.

TI  - Large language models for generating medical examinations: systematic review.
PG  - 354
LID - 10.1186/s12909-024-05239-y [doi]
LID - 354
AB  - BACKGROUND: Writing multiple choice questions (MCQs) for the purpose of medical 
      exams is challenging. It requires extensive medical knowledge, time and effort 
      from medical educators. This systematic review focuses on the application of 
      large language models (LLMs) in generating medical MCQs. METHODS: The authors 
      searched for studies published up to November 2023. Search terms focused on LLMs 
      generated MCQs for medical examinations. Non-English, out of year range and 
      studies not focusing on AI generated multiple-choice questions were excluded. 
      MEDLINE was used as a search database. Risk of bias was evaluated using a 
      tailored QUADAS-2 tool. RESULTS: Overall, eight studies published between April 
      2023 and October 2023 were included. Six studies used Chat-GPT 3.5, while two 
      employed GPT 4. Five studies showed that LLMs can produce competent questions 
      valid for medical exams. Three studies used LLMs to write medical questions but 
      did not evaluate the validity of the questions. One study conducted a comparative 
      analysis of different models. One other study compared LLM-generated questions 
      with those written by humans. All studies presented faulty questions that were 
      deemed inappropriate for medical exams. Some questions required additional 
      modifications in order to qualify. CONCLUSIONS: LLMs can be used to write MCQs 
      for medical examinations. However, their limitations cannot be ignored. Further 
      study in this field is essential and more conclusive evidence is needed. Until 
      then, LLMs may serve as a supplementary tool for writing medical examinations. 2 
      studies were at high risk of bias. The study followed the Preferred Reporting 
      Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

AB  - PURPOSE: We aimed to describe the performance and evaluate the educational value 
      of justifications provided by artificial intelligence chatbots, including 
      GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Bard, Claude, and Bing, on the Peruvian National Medical 
      Licensing Examination (P-NLME). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional analytical 
      study. On July 25, 2023, each multiple-choice question (MCQ) from the P-NLME was 
      entered into each chatbot (GPT-3, GPT-4, Bing, Bard, and Claude) 3 times. Then, 4 
      medical educators categorized the MCQs in terms of medical area, item type, and 
      whether the MCQ required Peru-specific knowledge. They assessed the educational 
      value of the justifications from the 2 top performers (GPT-4 and Bing). RESULTS: 
      GPT-4 scored 86.7% and Bing scored 82.2%, followed by Bard and Claude, and the 
      historical performance of Peruvian examinees was 55%. Among the factors 
      associated with correct answers, only MCQs that required Peru-specific knowledge 
      had lower odds (odds ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.09-0.61), whereas 
      the remaining factors showed no associations. In assessing the educational value 
      of justifications provided by GPT-4 and Bing, neither showed any significant 
      differences in certainty, usefulness, or potential use in the classroom. 
      CONCLUSION: Among chatbots, GPT-4 and Bing were the top performers, with Bing 
      performing better at Peru-specific MCQs. Moreover, the educational value of 
      justifications provided by the GPT-4 and Bing could be deemed appropriate. 
      However, it is essential to start addressing the educational value of these 
      chatbots, rather than merely their performance on examinations.

AB  - To compare the performance of humans, GPT-4.0 and GPT-3.5 in answering 
      multiple-choice questions from the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) Basic 
      and Clinical Science Course (BCSC) self-assessment program, available at 
      https://www.aao.org/education/self-assessments . In June 2023, text-based 
      multiple-choice questions were submitted to GPT-4.0 and GPT-3.5. The AAO provides 
      the percentage of humans who selected the correct answer, which was analyzed for 
      comparison. All questions were classified by 10 subspecialties and 3 practice 
      areas (diagnostics/clinics, medical treatment, surgery). Out of 1023 questions, 
      GPT-4.0 achieved the best score (82.4%), followed by humans (75.7%) and GPT-3.5 
      (65.9%), with significant difference in accuracy rates (always Pâ&lt;â0.0001). Both 
      GPT-4.0 and GPT-3.5 showed the worst results in surgery-related questions (74.6% 
      and 57.0% respectively). For difficult questions (answered incorrectly byâ&gt;â50% 
      of humans), both GPT models favorably compared to humans, without reaching 
      significancy. The word count for answers provided by GPT-4.0 was significantly 
      lower than those produced by GPT-3.5 (160âÂ±â56 and 206âÂ±â77 respectively, 
      Pâ&lt;â0.0001); however, incorrect responses were longer (Pâ&lt;â0.02). GPT-4.0 
      represented a substantial improvement over GPT-3.5, achieving better performance 
      than humans in an AAO BCSC self-assessment test. However, ChatGPT is still 
      limited by inconsistency across different practice areas, especially when it 
      comes to surgery.

AB  - The success of deep-learning algorithms in analyzing complex structured and 
      unstructured multidimensional data has caused an exponential increase in the 
      amount of research devoted to the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in 
      medicine in the past decade. Public release of large language models like ChatGPT 
      the past year has generated an unprecedented storm of excitement and rumors of 
      machine intelligence finally reaching or even surpassing human capability in 
      detecting meaningful signals in complex multivariate data. Such enthusiasm, 
      however, is met with an equal degree of both skepticism and fear over the social, 
      legal, and moral implications of such powerful technology with relatively little 
      safeguards or regulations on its development. The question remains in medicine of 
      how to harness the power of AI to improve patient outcomes by increasing the 
      diagnostic accuracy and treatment precision provided by medical professionals. 
      Military medicine, given its unique mission and resource constraints,can benefit 
      immensely from such technology. However, reaping such benefits hinges on the 
      ability of the rising generations of military medical professionals to understand 
      AI algorithms and their applications. Additionally, they should strongly consider 
      working with them as an adjunct decision-maker and view them as a colleague to 
      access and harness relevant information as opposed to something to be feared. 
      Ideas expressed in this commentary were formulated by a military medical student 
      during a two-month research elective working on a multidisciplinary team of 
      computer scientists and clinicians at the National Library of Medicine advancing 
      the state of the art of AI in medicine. A motivation to incorporate AI in the 
      Military Health System is provided, including examples of applications in 
      military medicine. Rationale is then given for inclusion of AI in education 
      starting in medical school as well as a prudent implementation of these 
      algorithms in a clinical workflow during graduate medical education. Finally, 
      barriers to implementation are addressed along with potential solutions. The end 
      state is not that rising military physicians are technical experts in AI; but 
      rather that they understand how they can leverage its rapidly evolving 
      capabilities to prepare for a future where AI will have a significant role in 
      clinical care. The overall goal is to develop trained clinicians that can 
      leverage these technologies to improve the Military Health System.

TI  - Developing prompts from large language model for extracting clinical information 
      from pathology and ultrasound reports in breast cancer.
PG  - 209-216
LID - 10.3857/roj.2023.00633 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We aimed to evaluate the time and cost of developing prompts using large 
      language model (LLM), tailored to extract clinical factors in breast cancer 
      patients and their accuracy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected data from 
      reports of surgical pathology and ultrasound from breast cancer patients who 
      underwent radiotherapy from 2020 to 2022. We extracted the information using the 
      Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) for Sheets and Docs extension plugin and 
      termed this the "LLM" method. The time and cost of developing the prompts with 
      LLM methods were assessed and compared with those spent on collecting information 
      with "full manual" and "LLM-assisted manual" methods. To assess accuracy, 340 
      patients were randomly selected, and the extracted information by LLM method were 
      compared with those collected by "full manual" method. RESULTS: Data from 2,931 
      patients were collected. We developed 12 prompts for Extract function and 12 for 
      Format function to extract and standardize the information. The overall accuracy 
      was 87.7%. For lymphovascular invasion, it was 98.2%. Developing and processing 
      the prompts took 3.5 hours and 15 minutes, respectively. Utilizing the ChatGPT 
      application programming interface cost US $65.8 and when factoring in the 
      estimated wage, the total cost was US $95.4. In an estimated comparison, 
      "LLM-assisted manual" and "LLM" methods were time- and cost-efficient compared to 
      the "full manual" method. CONCLUSION: Developing and facilitating prompts for LLM 
      to derive clinical factors was efficient to extract crucial information from huge 
      medical records. This study demonstrated the potential of the application of 
      natural language processing using LLM model in breast cancer patients. Prompts 
      from the current study can be re-used for other research to collect clinical 
      information.

AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study is to use generative artificial intelligence to 
      perform bibliometric analysis on abstracts published at European Resuscitation 
      Council (ERC) annual scientific congress and define trends in ERC guidelines 
      topics over the last decade. METHODS: In this bibliometric analysis, the WebHarvy 
      software (SysNucleus, India) was used to download data from the Resuscitation 
      journal's website through the technique of web scraping. Next, the Chat 
      Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (ChatGPT-4) application programming 
      interface (Open AI, USA) was used to implement the multinomial classification of 
      abstract titles following the ERC 2021 guidelines topics. RESULTS: From 2012 to 
      2022 a total of 2491 abstracts have been published at ERC congresses. Published 
      abstracts ranged from 88 (in 2020) to 368 (in 2015). On average, the most common 
      ERC guidelines topics were Adult basic life support (50.1%), followed by Adult 
      advanced life support (41.5%), while Newborn resuscitation and support of 
      transition of infants at birth (2.1%) was the least common topic. The findings 
      also highlight that the Basic Life Support and Adult Advanced Life Support ERC 
      guidelines topics have the strongest co-occurrence to all ERC guidelines topics, 
      where the Newborn resuscitation and support of transition of infants at birth 
      (2.1%; 52/2491) ERC guidelines topic has the weakest co-occurrence. CONCLUSION: 
      This study demonstrates the capabilities of generative artificial intelligence in 
      the bibliometric analysis of abstract titles using the example of resuscitation 
      medicine research over the last decade at ERC conferences using large language 
      models.

TI  - Performance of Large Language Models on a Neurology Board-Style Examination.
PG  - e2346721

LID - e2346721
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown 
      potential in a wide array of applications, including health care. While LLMs 
      showed heterogeneous results across specialized medical board examinations, the 
      performance of these models in neurology board examinations remains unexplored. 
      OBJECTIVE: To assess the performance of LLMs on neurology board-style 
      examinations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study was 
      conducted between May 17 and May 31, 2023. The evaluation utilized a question 
      bank approved by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology and was validated 
      with a small question cohort by the European Board for Neurology. All questions 
      were categorized into lower-order (recall, understanding) and higher-order 
      (apply, analyze, synthesize) questions based on the Bloom taxonomy for learning 
      and assessment. Performance by LLM ChatGPT versions 3.5 (LLM 1) and 4 (LLM 2) was 
      assessed in relation to overall scores, question type, and topics, along with the 
      confidence level and reproducibility of answers. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 
      Overall percentage scores of 2 LLMs. RESULTS: LLM 2 significantly outperformed 
      LLM 1 by correctly answering 1662 of 1956 questions (85.0%) vs 1306 questions 
      (66.8%) for LLM 1. Notably, LLM 2's performance was greater than the mean human 
      score of 73.8%, effectively achieving near-passing and passing grades in the 
      neurology board examination. LLM 2 outperformed human users in behavioral, 
      cognitive, and psychological-related questions and demonstrated superior 
      performance to LLM 1 in 6 categories. Both LLMs performed better on lower-order 
      than higher-order questions, with LLM 2 excelling in both lower-order and 
      higher-order questions. Both models consistently used confident language, even 
      when providing incorrect answers. Reproducible answers of both LLMs were 
      associated with a higher percentage of correct answers than inconsistent answers. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Despite the absence of neurology-specific training, 
      LLM 2 demonstrated commendable performance, whereas LLM 1 performed slightly 
      below the human average. While higher-order cognitive tasks were more challenging 
      for both models, LLM 2's results were equivalent to passing grades in specialized 
      neurology examinations. These findings suggest that LLMs could have significant 
      applications in clinical neurology and health care with further refinements.

TI  - Detecting generative artificial intelligence in scientific articles: Evasion 
      techniques and implications for scientific integrity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) tools, although beneficial for data 
      collection and analysis, can also facilitate scientific fraud. AI detectors can 
      help resolve this problem, but their effectiveness depends on their ability to 
      track AI progress. In addition, many methods of evading AI detection exist and 
      their constantly evolving sophistication can make the task more difficult. Thus, 
      from an AI-generated text, we wanted to: (1) evaluate the AI detection sites on a 
      text generated entirely by the AI, (2) test the methods described for evading AI 
      detection, and (3) evaluate the effectiveness of these methods to evade AI 
      detection on the sites tested previously. HYPOTHESIS: Not all AI detection tools 
      are equally effective in detecting AI-generated text and some techniques used to 
      evade ÐI detection can make an AI-produced text almost undetectable. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: We created a text with ChatGPT-4 (Chat GÐµnÐµrÐ°tivÐµ PrÐµ-trained 
      Transformer) and submitted it to 11 ÐI detection web tools (ÐriginÐ°lity, ZÐµrÐ¾GPT, 
      WritÐµr, CÐ¾pylÐµÐ°ks, CrÐ¾ssplag, GPTZÐµrÐ¾, Sapling, CÐ¾ntÐµnt Ð°t scÐ°lÐµ, CÐ¾rrÐµctÐ¾r, 
      WritÐµfull Ðµt Quill), bÐµfÐ¾rÐµ Ð°nd Ð°ftÐµr applying strategies to minimise AI 
      detection. The strategies used to minimize AI detection were the improvement of 
      command messages in ChatPGT, the introduction of minor grammatical errors such as 
      comma deletion, paraphrasing, and the substitution of Latin letters with similar 
      Cyrillic letters (a and Ð¾) which is also a method used elsewhere to evade the 
      detection of plagiarism. We have also tested the effectiveness of these tools in 
      correctly identifying a scientific text written by a human in 1960. RESULTS: From 
      the initial text generated by the AI, 7 of the 11 detectors concluded that the 
      text was mainly written by humans. Subsequently, the introduction of simple 
      modifications, such as the removal of commas or paraphrasing can effectively 
      reduce AI detection and make the text appear human for all detectors. In 
      addition, replacing certain Latin letters with Cyrillic letters can make an AI 
      text completely undetectable. Finally, we observe that in a paradoxical way, 
      certain sites detect a significant proportion of AI in a text written by a human 
      in 1960. DISCUSSION: AI detectors have low efficiency, and simple modifications 
      can allow even the most robust detectors to be easily bypassed. The rapid 
      development of generative AI raises questions about the future of scientific 
      writing but also about the detection of scientific fraud, such as data 
      fabrication. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III Control case study.

AB  - This perspective highlights the importance of addressing social determinants of 
      health (SDOH) in patient health outcomes and health inequity, a global problem 
      exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We provide a broad discussion on current 
      developments in digital health and artificial intelligence (AI), including large 
      language models (LLMs), as transformative tools in addressing SDOH factors, 
      offering new capabilities for disease surveillance and patient care. 
      Simultaneously, we bring attention to challenges, such as data standardization, 
      infrastructure limitations, digital literacy, and algorithmic bias, that could 
      hinder equitable access to AI benefits. For LLMs, we highlight potential unique 
      challenges and risks including environmental impact, unfair labor practices, 
      inadvertent disinformation or "hallucinations," proliferation of bias, and 
      infringement of copyrights. We propose the need for a multitiered approach to 
      digital inclusion as an SDOH and the development of ethical and responsible AI 
      practice frameworks globally and provide suggestions on bridging the gap from 
      development to implementation of equitable AI technologies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinicians often lack the necessary expertise to differentially 
      diagnose multiple underlying rare diseases (RDs) due to their complex and 
      overlapping clinical features, leading to misdiagnoses and delayed treatments. 
      The aim of this study is to develop a novel electronic differential diagnostic 
      support system for RDs. METHOD: Through integrating two Bayesian diagnostic 
      methods, a candidate list was generated with enhance clinical interpretability 
      for the further Q&amp;A based differential diagnosis (DDX). To achieve an efficient 
      Q&amp;A dialogue strategy, we introduce a novel metric named the adaptive information 
      gain and Gini index (AIGGI) to evaluate the expected gain of interrogated 
      phenotypes within real-time diagnostic states. RESULTS: This DDX tool called 
      RDmaster has been implemented as a web-based platform 
      (http://rdmaster.nbscn.org/). A diagnostic trial involving 238 published RD 
      patients revealed that RDmaster outperformed existing RD diagnostic tools, as 
      well as ChatGPT, and was shown to enhance the diagnostic accuracy through its Q&amp;A 
      system. CONCLUSIONS: The RDmaster offers an effective multi-omics differential 
      diagnostic technique and outperforms existing tools and popular large language 
      models, particularly enhancing differential diagnosis in collecting 
      diagnostically beneficial phenotypes.

TI  - Mapping the Heartbeat of America with ChatGPT-4: Unpacking the Interplay of 
      Social Vulnerability, Digital Literacy, and Cardiovascular Mortality in County 
      Residency Choices.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the 
      United States (US). Although high-quality data are accessible in the US for 
      cardiovascular research, digital literacy (DL) has not been explored as a 
      potential factor influencing cardiovascular mortality, although the Social 
      Vulnerability Index (SVI) has been used previously as a variable in predictive 
      modeling. Utilizing a large language model, ChatGPT4, we investigated the 
      variability in CVD-specific mortality that could be explained by DL and SVI using 
      regression modeling. We fitted two models to calculate the crude and adjusted CVD 
      mortality rates. Mortality data using ICD-10 codes were retrieved from CDC 
      WONDER, and the geographic level data was retrieved from the US Department of 
      Agriculture. Both datasets were merged using the Federal Information Processing 
      Standards code. The initial exploration involved data from 1999 through 2020 (n = 
      65,791; 99.98% complete for all US Counties) for crude cardiovascular mortality 
      (CCM). Age-adjusted cardiovascular mortality (ACM) had data for 2020 (n = 3118 
      rows; 99% complete for all US Counties), with the inclusion of SVI and DL in the 
      model (a composite of literacy and internet access). By leveraging on the 
      advanced capabilities of ChatGPT4 and linear regression, we successfully 
      highlighted the importance of incorporating the SVI and DL in predicting adjusted 
      cardiovascular mortality. Our findings imply that just incorporating internet 
      availability in the regression model may not be sufficient without incorporating 
      significant variables, such as DL and SVI, to predict ACM. Further, our approach 
      could enable future researchers to consider DL and SVI as key variables to study 
      other health outcomes of public-health importance, which could inform future 
      clinical practices and policies.

AB  - Humans are universally good in providing stable and accurate judgments about what 
      forms part of their language and what not. Large Language Models (LMs) are 
      claimed to possess human-like language abilities; hence, they are expected to 
      emulate this behavior by providing both stable and accurate answers, when asked 
      whether a string of words complies with or deviates from their next-word 
      predictions. This work tests whether stability and accuracy are showcased by 
      GPT-3/text-davinci-002, GPT-3/text-davinci-003, and ChatGPT, using a series of 
      judgment tasks that tap on 8 linguistic phenomena: plural attraction, anaphora, 
      center embedding, comparatives, intrusive resumption, negative polarity items, 
      order of adjectives, and order of adverbs. For every phenomenon, 10 sentences (5 
      grammatical and 5 ungrammatical) are tested, each randomly repeated 10 times, 
      totaling 800 elicited judgments per LM (total n = 2,400). Our results reveal 
      variable above-chance accuracy in the grammatical condition, below-chance 
      accuracy in the ungrammatical condition, a significant instability of answers 
      across phenomena, and a yes-response bias for all the tested LMs. Furthermore, we 
      found no evidence that repetition aids the Models to converge on a processing 
      strategy that culminates in stable answers, either accurate or inaccurate. We 
      demonstrate that the LMs' performance in identifying (un)grammatical word 
      patterns is in stark contrast to what is observed in humans (n = 80, tested on 
      the same tasks) and argue that adopting LMs as theories of human language is not 
      motivated at their current stage of development.

TI  - Text Matching in Insurance Question-Answering Community Based on an Integrated 
      BiLSTM-TextCNN Model Fusing Multi-Feature.
LID - 10.3390/e25040639 [doi]
LID - 639
AB  - Along with the explosion of ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence 
      question-answering system has been pushed to a climax. Intelligent 
      question-answering enables computers to simulate people's behavior habits of 
      understanding a corpus through machine learning, so as to answer questions in 
      professional fields. How to obtain more accurate answers to personalized 
      questions in professional fields is the core content of intelligent 
      question-answering research. As one of the key technologies of intelligent 
      question-answering, the accuracy of text matching is related to the development 
      of the intelligent question-answering community. Aiming to solve the problem of 
      polysemy of text, the Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration 
      (ERNIE) model is used to obtain the word vector representation of text, which 
      makes up for the lack of prior knowledge in the traditional word vector 
      representation model. Additionally, there are also problems of homophones and 
      polyphones in Chinese, so this paper introduces the phonetic character sequence 
      of the text to distinguish them. In addition, aiming at the problem that there 
      are many proper nouns in the insurance field that are difficult to identify, 
      after conventional part-of-speech tagging, proper nouns are distinguished by 
      especially defining their parts of speech. After the above three types of 
      text-based semantic feature extensions, this paper also uses the Bi-directional 
      Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and TextCNN models to extract the global features 
      and local features of the text, respectively. It can obtain the feature 
      representation of the text more comprehensively. Thus, the text matching model 
      integrating BiLSTM and TextCNN fusing Multi-Feature (namely MFBT) is proposed for 
      the insurance question-answering community. The MFBT model aims to solve the 
      problems that affect the answer selection in the insurance question-answering 
      community, such as proper nouns, nonstandard sentences and sparse features. 
      Taking the question-and-answer data of the insurance library as the sample, the 
      MFBT text-matching model is compared and evaluated with other models. The 
      experimental results show that the MFBT text-matching model has higher evaluation 
      index values, including accuracy, recall and F1, than other models. The model 
      trained by historical search data can better help users in the insurance 
      question-and-answer community obtain the answers they need and improve their 
      satisfaction.

LID - 139
AB  - Shared decision-making (SDM) is crucial in neuro-oncology, fostering 
      collaborations between patients and healthcare professionals to navigate 
      treatment options. However, the complexity of neuro-oncological conditions and 
      the cognitive and emotional burdens on patients present significant barriers to 
      achieving effective SDM. This discussion explores the potential of large language 
      models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard to overcome these 
      barriers, offering a means to enhance patient understanding and engagement in 
      their care. LLMs, by providing accessible, personalized information, could 
      support but not supplant the critical insights of healthcare professionals. The 
      hypothesis suggests that patients, better informed through LLMs, may participate 
      more actively in their treatment choices. Integrating LLMs into neuro-oncology 
      requires navigating ethical considerations, including safeguarding patient data 
      and ensuring informed consent, alongside the judicious use of AI technologies. 
      Future efforts should focus on establishing ethical guidelines, adapting 
      healthcare workflows, promoting patient-oriented research, and developing 
      training programs for clinicians on the use of LLMs. Continuous evaluation of LLM 
      applications will be vital to maintain their effectiveness and alignment with 
      patient needs. Ultimately, this exploration contends that the thoughtful 
      integration of LLMs into SDM processes could significantly enhance patient 
      involvement and strengthen the patient-physician relationship in neuro-oncology 
      care.

TI  - Large language models and bariatric surgery patient education: a comparative 
      readability analysis of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Bard, and online institutional resources.
LID - 10.1007/s00464-024-10720-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The readability of online bariatric surgery patient education 
      materials (PEMs) often surpasses the recommended 6th grade level. Large language 
      models (LLMs), like ChatGPT and Bard, have the potential to revolutionize PEM 
      delivery. We aimed to evaluate the readability of PEMs produced by U.S. medical 
      institutions compared to LLMs, as well as the ability of LLMs to simplify their 
      responses. METHODS: Responses to frequently asked questions (FAQs) related to 
      bariatric surgery were gathered from top-ranked health institutions. FAQ 
      responses were also generated from GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard. LLMs were then 
      prompted to improve the readability of their initial responses. The readability 
      of institutional responses, initial LLM responses, and simplified LLM responses 
      were graded using validated readability formulas. Accuracy and comprehensiveness 
      of initial and simplified LLM responses were also compared. RESULTS: Responses to 
      66 FAQs were included. All institutional and initial LLM responses had poor 
      readability, with average reading levels ranging from 9th grade to college 
      graduate. Simplified responses from LLMs had significantly improved readability, 
      with reading levels ranging from 6th grade to college freshman. When comparing 
      simplified LLM responses, GPT-4 responses demonstrated the highest readability, 
      with reading levels ranging from 6th to 9th grade. Accuracy was similar between 
      initial and simplified responses from all LLMs. Comprehensiveness was similar 
      between initial and simplified responses from GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. However, 34.8% 
      of Bard's simplified responses were graded as less comprehensive compared to 
      initial. CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the efficacy of LLMs in enhancing the 
      readability of bariatric surgery PEMs. GPT-4 outperformed other models, 
      generating simplified PEMs from 6th to 9th grade reading levels. Unlike GPT-3.5 
      and GPT-4, Bard's simplified responses were graded as less comprehensive. We 
      advocate for future studies examining the potential role of LLMs as dynamic and 
      personalized sources of PEMs for diverse patient populations of all literacy 
      levels.

TI  - The performance of ChatGPT on orthopaedic in-service training exams: A 
      comparative study of the GPT-3.5 turbo and GPT-4 models in orthopaedic education.
PG  - 70-75
LID - 10.1016/j.jor.2023.11.056 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly 
      the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Generative Pretrained 
      Transformers (GPTs), has revolutionized numerous fields. The purpose of this 
      study is to investigate the application of LLMs within the realm of orthopaedic 
      in training examinations. METHODS: Questions from the 2020-2022 Orthopaedic 
      In-Service Training Exams (OITEs) were given to OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 
      LLMs, using a zero-shot inference approach. Each model was given a 
      multiple-choice question, without prior exposure to similar queries, and their 
      generated responses were compared to the correct answer within each OITE. The 
      models were evaluated on overall accuracy, performance on questions with and 
      without media, and performance on first- and higher-order questions. RESULTS: The 
      GPT-4 model outperformed the GPT-3.5 Turbo model across all years and question 
      categories (2022: 67.63% vs. 50.24%; 2021: 58.69% vs. 47.42%; 2020: 59.53% vs. 
      46.51%). Both models showcased better performance with questions devoid of 
      associated media, with GPT-4 attaining accuracies of 68.80%, 65.14%, and 68.22% 
      for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. GPT-4 outscored GPT-3.5 Turbo on 
      first-order questions across all years (2022: 63.83% vs. 38.30%; 2021: 57.45% vs. 
      50.00%; 2020: 65.74% vs. 53.70%). GPT-4 also outscored GPT-3.5 Turbo on 
      higher-order questions across all years (2022: 68.75% vs. 53.75%; 2021: 59.66% 
      vs. 45.38%; 2020: 53.27% vs. 39.25%). DISCUSSION: GPT-4 showed improved 
      performance compared to GPT-3.5 Turbo in all tested categories. The results 
      reflect the potential and limitations of AI in orthopaedics. GPT-4's performance 
      is comparable to a second-to-third-year resident and GPT-3.5 Turbo's performance 
      is comparable to a first-year resident, suggesting the application of current 
      LLMs can neither pass the OITE nor substitute orthopaedic training. This study 
      sets a precedent for future endeavors integrating GPT models into orthopaedic 
      education and underlines the necessity for specialized training of these models 
      for specific medical domains.

TI  - Tracking persistent postoperative opioid use: a proof-of-concept study 
      demonstrating a use case for natural language processing.
PG  - 241-247
LID - 10.1136/rapm-2023-104629 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Large language models have been gaining tremendous popularity since 
      the introduction of ChatGPT in late 2022. Perioperative pain providers should 
      leverage natural language processing (NLP) technology and explore pertinent use 
      cases to improve patient care. One example is tracking persistent postoperative 
      opioid use after surgery. Since much of the relevant data may be 'hidden' within 
      unstructured clinical text, NLP models may prove to be advantageous. The primary 
      objective of this proof-of-concept study was to demonstrate the ability of an NLP 
      engine to review clinical notes and accurately identify patients who had 
      persistent postoperative opioid use after major spine surgery. METHODS: Clinical 
      documents from all patients that underwent major spine surgery during July 
      2015-August 2021 were extracted from the electronic health record. The primary 
      outcome was persistent postoperative opioid use, defined as continued use of 
      opioids greater than or equal to 3âmonths after surgery. This outcome was 
      ascertained via manual clinician review from outpatient spine surgery follow-up 
      notes. An NLP engine was applied to these notes to ascertain the presence of 
      persistent opioid use-this was then compared with results from clinician manual 
      review. RESULTS: The final study sample consisted of 965 patients, in which 705 
      (73.1%) were determined to have persistent opioid use following surgery. The NLP 
      engine correctly determined the patients' opioid use status in 92.9% of cases, in 
      which it correctly identified persistent opioid use in 95.6% of cases and no 
      persistent opioid use in 86.1% of cases. DISCUSSION: Access to unstructured data 
      within the perioperative history can contextualize patients' opioid use and 
      provide further insight into the opioid crisis, while at the same time improve 
      care directly at the patient level. While these goals are in reach, future work 
      is needed to evaluate how to best implement NLP within different healthcare 
      systems for use in clinical decision support.

TI  - Evaluating Large Language Models for the National Premedical Exam in India: 
      Comparative Analysis of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard.
PG  - e51523
LID - 10.2196/51523 [doi]
LID - e51523
AB  - BACKGROUND: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language 
      processing with their ability to generate human-like text through extensive 
      training on large data sets. These models, including Generative Pre-trained 
      Transformers (GPT)-3.5 (OpenAI), GPT-4 (OpenAI), and Bard (Google LLC), find 
      applications beyond natural language processing, attracting interest from 
      academia and industry. Students are actively leveraging LLMs to enhance learning 
      experiences and prepare for high-stakes exams, such as the National Eligibility 
      cum Entrance Test (NEET) in India. OBJECTIVE: This comparative analysis aims to 
      evaluate the performance of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard in answering NEET-2023 
      questions. METHODS: In this paper, we evaluated the performance of the 3 
      mainstream LLMs, namely GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Google Bard, in answering questions 
      related to the NEET-2023 exam. The questions of the NEET were provided to these 
      artificial intelligence models, and the responses were recorded and compared 
      against the correct answers from the official answer key. Consensus was used to 
      evaluate the performance of all 3 models. RESULTS: It was evident that GPT-4 
      passed the entrance test with flying colors (300/700, 42.9%), showcasing 
      exceptional performance. On the other hand, GPT-3.5 managed to meet the 
      qualifying criteria, but with a substantially lower score (145/700, 20.7%). 
      However, Bard (115/700, 16.4%) failed to meet the qualifying criteria and did not 
      pass the test. GPT-4 demonstrated consistent superiority over Bard and GPT-3.5 in 
      all 3 subjects. Specifically, GPT-4 achieved accuracy rates of 73% (29/40) in 
      physics, 44% (16/36) in chemistry, and 51% (50/99) in biology. Conversely, 
      GPT-3.5 attained an accuracy rate of 45% (18/40) in physics, 33% (13/26) in 
      chemistry, and 34% (34/99) in biology. The accuracy consensus metric showed that 
      the matching responses between GPT-4 and Bard, as well as GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, had 
      higher incidences of being correct, at 0.56 and 0.57, respectively, compared to 
      the matching responses between Bard and GPT-3.5, which stood at 0.42. When all 3 
      models were considered together, their matching responses reached the highest 
      accuracy consensus of 0.59. CONCLUSIONS: The study's findings provide valuable 
      insights into the performance of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard in answering NEET-2023 
      questions. GPT-4 emerged as the most accurate model, highlighting its potential 
      for educational applications. Cross-checking responses across models may result 
      in confusion as the compared models (as duos or a trio) tend to agree on only a 
      little over half of the correct responses. Using GPT-4 as one of the compared 
      models will result in higher accuracy consensus. The results underscore the 
      suitability of LLMs for high-stakes exams and their positive impact on education. 
      Additionally, the study establishes a benchmark for evaluating and enhancing 
      LLMs' performance in educational tasks, promoting responsible and informed use of 
      these models in diverse learning environments.

LID - 1352420
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mental illnesses represent a significant global health challenge, 
      affecting millions with far-reaching social and economic impacts. Traditional 
      exercise prescriptions for mental health often adopt a one-size-fits-all 
      approach, which overlooks individual variations in mental and physical health. 
      Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) offer an opportunity to 
      tailor these interventions more effectively. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to 
      develop and evaluate a multimodal data-driven AI system for personalized exercise 
      prescriptions, targeting individuals with mental illnesses. By leveraging AI, the 
      study seeks to overcome the limitations of conventional exercise regimens and 
      improve adherence and mental health outcomes. METHODS: The study is conducted in 
      two phases. Initially, 1,000 participants will be recruited for AI model training 
      and testing, with 800 forming the training set, augmented by 9,200 simulated 
      samples generated by ChatGPT, and 200 as the testing set. Data annotation will be 
      performed by experienced physicians from the Department of Mental Health at 
      Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital. Subsequently, a randomized 
      controlled trial (RCT) with 40 participants will be conducted to compare the 
      AI-driven exercise prescriptions against standard care. Assessments will be 
      scheduled at 6, 12, and 18âmonths to evaluate cognitive, physical, and 
      psychological outcomes. EXPECTED OUTCOMES: The AI-driven system is expected to 
      demonstrate greater effectiveness in improving mental health outcomes compared to 
      standard exercise prescriptions. Personalized exercise regimens, informed by 
      comprehensive data analysis, are anticipated to enhance participant adherence and 
      overall mental well-being. These outcomes could signify a paradigm shift in 
      exercise prescription for mental health, paving the way for more personalized and 
      effective treatment modalities. REGISTRATION AND ETHICAL APPROVAL: This is 
      approved by Human Experimental Ethics Inspection of Guangzhou Sport University, 
      and the registration is under review by ChiCTR.

AB  - AIMS: Natural language processing chatbots (NLPC) can be used to gather 
      information for medical content. However, these tools contain a potential risk of 
      misinformation. This study aims to evaluate different aspects of responses given 
      by different NLPCs on questions about atrial fibrillation (AF) and clinical 
      implantable electronic devices (CIED). METHODS AND RESULTS: Questions were 
      entered into three different NLPC interfaces. Responses were evaluated with 
      regard to appropriateness, comprehensibility, appearance of confabulation, 
      absence of relevant content, and recommendations given for clinically relevant 
      decisions. Moreover, readability was assessed by calculating word count and 
      Flesch Reading Ease score. 52, 60, and 84% of responses on AF and 16, 72, and 88% 
      on CIEDs were evaluated to be appropriate for all responses given by Google Bard, 
      (GB) Bing Chat (BC) and ChatGPT Plus (CGP), respectively. Assessment of 
      comprehensibility showed that 96, 88, and 92% of responses on AF and 92 and 88%, 
      and 100% on CIEDs were comprehensible for all responses created by GB, BC, and 
      CGP, respectively. Readability varied between different NLPCs. Relevant aspects 
      were missing in 52% (GB), 60% (BC), and 24% (CGP) for AF, and in 92% (GB), 88% 
      (BC), and 52% (CGP) for CIEDs. CONCLUSION: Responses generated by an NLPC are 
      mostly easy to understand with varying readability between the different NLPCs. 
      The appropriateness of responses is limited and varies between different NLPCs. 
      Important aspects are often missed to be mentioned. Thus, chatbots should be used 
      with caution to gather medical information about cardiac arrhythmias and devices.

      Artificial Intelligence Programs: Jordan and West Bank of Palestine.
PG  - 1391-1400
LID - 10.2147/AMEP.S433255 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) programs generate responses to input 
      text, showcasing their innovative capabilities in education and demonstrating 
      various potential benefits, particularly in the field of medical education. The 
      current knowledge of health profession students about AI programs has still not 
      been assessed in Jordan and the West Bank of Palestine (WBP). AIM: This study 
      aimed to assess students' awareness and practice of AI programs in medicine and 
      pharmacy in Jordan and the WBP. METHODS: This study was in the form of an 
      observational, cross-sectional survey. A questionnaire was electronically 
      distributed among students of medicine and pharmacy at An-Najah National 
      University (WBP), Al-Isra University (Jordan), and Al-Balqa Applied University 
      (Jordan). The questionnaire consisted of three main categories: sociodemographic 
      characteristics of the participants, practice of AI programs, and perceptions of 
      AI programs, including ChatGPT. RESULTS: A total of 321 students responded to the 
      distributed questionnaire, and 261 participants (81.3%) stated that they had 
      heard about AI programs. In addition, 135 participants had used AI programs 
      before (42.1%), while less than half the participants used them in their 
      university studies (44.2%): for drug information (44.5%), homework (38.9%), and 
      writing research articles (39.3%). There was significantly (48.3%, P&lt;0.005) more 
      conviction in the use of AI programs for writing research articles among pharmacy 
      students from Palestine compared to Jordan. Lastly, there was significantly more 
      (53.8%, P&lt;0.05) AI program use among medicine students than pharmacy students. 
      CONCLUSION: While most medicine and pharmacy students had heard about AI 
      programs, only a small proportion of the participants had used them in their 
      medical study. In addition, attitudes and practice related to AI programs in 
      their education differs between medicine and pharmacy students and between WBP 
      and Jordan.

TI  - Exploring artificial intelligence in the Nigerian medical educational space: An 
      online cross-sectional study of perceptions, risks and benefits among students 
      and lecturers from ten universities.
PG  - 285-292
LID - 10.4103/npmj.npmj_186_23 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The impact of artificial intelligence (AI) has been compared to that 
      of the Internet and printing, evoking both apprehension and anticipation in an 
      uncertain world. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the perceptions of 
      medical students and faculty members from ten universities across Nigeria 
      regarding AI. METHODS: Using Google Forms and WhatsApp, a cross-sectional online 
      survey was administered to clinical year medical students and their lecturers 
      from ten medical schools representing all the six geopolitical zones of Nigeria. 
      RESULTS: The survey received 1003 responses, of which 708 (70.7%) were from 
      students and 294 (29.3%) were from lecturers. Both groups displayed an average 
      level of knowledge, with students (Median:4, range -5 to 12) significantly 
      outperforming lecturers (Median:3, range -5 to 15). Social media (61.2%) was the 
      most common form of first contact with AI. Participants demonstrated a favourable 
      attitude towards AI, with a median score of 6.8 out of 10. Grammar checkers 
      (62.3%) were the most commonly reported AI tool used, while ChatGPT (43.6%) was 
      the most frequently mentioned dedicated AI tool. Students were significantly more 
      likely than lecturers to have used AI tools in the past but &lt;5% of both groups 
      had received prior AI training. Excitement about the potential of AI slightly 
      outweighed concerns regarding future risks. A significantly higher proportion of 
      students compared to lecturers believed that AI could dehumanise health care 
      (70.6% vs. 60.8%), render physicians redundant (57.6% vs. 34.7%), diminish 
      physicians' skills (79.3% vs. 71.3%) and ultimately harm patients (28.6% vs. 
      20.6%). CONCLUSION: The simultaneous fascination and apprehension with AI 
      observed among both lecturers and students in our study mirrors the global trend. 
      This finding was particularly evident in students who, despite possessing greater 
      knowledge of AI compared to their lecturers, did not exhibit a corresponding 
      reduction in their fear of AI.

TI  - Teaching AI Ethics in Medical Education: A Scoping Review of Current Literature 
      and Practices.
PG  - 399-410
LID - 10.5334/pme.954 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The increasing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in medicine has 
      raised ethical concerns, such as patient autonomy, bias, and transparency. Recent 
      studies suggest a need for teaching AI ethics as part of medical curricula. This 
      scoping review aimed to represent and synthesize the literature on teaching AI 
      ethics as part of medical education. METHODS: The PRISMA-SCR guidelines and JBI 
      methodology guided a literature search in four databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, 
      and Web of Science) for the past 22 years (2000-2022). To account for the release 
      of AI-based chat applications, such as ChatGPT, the literature search was updated 
      to include publications until the end of June 2023. RESULTS: 1384 publications 
      were originally identified and, after screening titles and abstracts, the full 
      text of 87 publications was assessed. Following the assessment of the full text, 
      10 publications were included for further analysis. The updated literature search 
      identified two additional relevant publications from 2023 were identified and 
      included in the analysis. All 12 publications recommended teaching AI ethics in 
      medical curricula due to the potential implications of AI in medicine. 
      Anticipated ethical challenges such as bias were identified as the recommended 
      basis for teaching content in addition to basic principles of medical ethics. 
      Case-based teaching using real-world examples in interactive seminars and small 
      groups was recommended as a teaching modality. CONCLUSION: This scoping review 
      reveals a scarcity of literature on teaching AI ethics in medical education, with 
      most of the available literature being recent and theoretical. These findings 
      emphasize the importance of more empirical studies and foundational definitions 
      of AI ethics to guide the development of teaching content and modalities. 
      Recognizing AI's significant impact of AI on medicine, additional research on the 
      teaching of AI ethics in medical education is needed to best prepare medical 
      students for future ethical challenges.

TI  - Automatic Segmentation with Deep Learning in Radiotherapy.
LID - 10.3390/cancers15174389 [doi]
LID - 4389
AB  - This review provides a formal overview of current automatic segmentation studies 
      that use deep learning in radiotherapy. It covers 807 published papers and 
      includes multiple cancer sites, image types (CT/MRI/PET), and segmentation 
      methods. We collect key statistics about the papers to uncover commonalities, 
      trends, and methods, and identify areas where more research might be needed. 
      Moreover, we analyzed the corpus by posing explicit questions aimed at providing 
      high-quality and actionable insights, including: "What should researchers think 
      about when starting a segmentation study?", "How can research practices in 
      medical image segmentation be improved?", "What is missing from the current 
      corpus?", and more. This allowed us to provide practical guidelines on how to 
      conduct a good segmentation study in today's competitive environment that will be 
      useful for future research within the field, regardless of the specific 
      radiotherapeutic subfield. To aid in our analysis, we used the large language 
      model ChatGPT to condense information.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize the drug 
      discovery process, offering improved efficiency, accuracy, and speed. However, 
      the successful application of AI is dependent on the availability of high-quality 
      data, the addressing of ethical concerns, and the recognition of the limitations 
      of AI-based approaches. In this article, the benefits, challenges, and drawbacks 
      of AI in this field are reviewed, and possible strategies and approaches for 
      overcoming the present obstacles are proposed. The use of data augmentation, 
      explainable AI, and the integration of AI with traditional experimental methods, 
      as well as the potential advantages of AI in pharmaceutical research, are also 
      discussed. Overall, this review highlights the potential of AI in drug discovery 
      and provides insights into the challenges and opportunities for realizing its 
      potential in this field. Note from the human authors: This article was created to 
      test the ability of ChatGPT, a chatbot based on the GPT-3.5 language model, in 
      terms of assisting human authors in writing review articles. The text generated 
      by the AI following our instructions (see Supporting Information) was used as a 
      starting point, and its ability to automatically generate content was evaluated. 
      After conducting a thorough review, the human authors practically rewrote the 
      manuscript, striving to maintain a balance between the original proposal and the 
      scientific criteria. The advantages and limitations of using AI for this purpose 
      are discussed in the last section.

TI  - Unlocking the Secrets Behind Advanced Artificial Intelligence Language Models in 
      Deidentifying Chinese-English Mixed Clinical Text: Development and Validation 
      Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The widespread use of electronic health records in the clinical and 
      biomedical fields makes the removal of protected health information (PHI) 
      essential to maintain privacy. However, a significant portion of information is 
      recorded in unstructured textual forms, posing a challenge for deidentification. 
      In multilingual countries, medical records could be written in a mixture of more 
      than one language, referred to as code mixing. Most current clinical natural 
      language processing techniques are designed for monolingual text, and there is a 
      need to address the deidentification of code-mixed text. OBJECTIVE: The aim of 
      this study was to investigate the effectiveness and underlying mechanism of 
      fine-tuned pretrained language models (PLMs) in identifying PHI in the code-mixed 
      context. Additionally, we aimed to evaluate the potential of prompting large 
      language models (LLMs) for recognizing PHI in a zero-shot manner. METHODS: We 
      compiled the first clinical code-mixed deidentification data set consisting of 
      text written in Chinese and English. We explored the effectiveness of fine-tuned 
      PLMs for recognizing PHI in code-mixed content, with a focus on whether PLMs 
      exploit naming regularity and mention coverage to achieve superior performance, 
      by probing the developed models' outputs to examine their decision-making 
      process. Furthermore, we investigated the potential of prompt-based in-context 
      learning of LLMs for recognizing PHI in code-mixed text. RESULTS: The developed 
      methods were evaluated on a code-mixed deidentification corpus of 1700 discharge 
      summaries. We observed that different PHI types had preferences in their 
      occurrences within the different types of language-mixed sentences, and PLMs 
      could effectively recognize PHI by exploiting the learned name regularity. 
      However, the models may exhibit suboptimal results when regularity is weak or 
      mentions contain unknown words that the representations cannot generate well. We 
      also found that the availability of code-mixed training instances is essential 
      for the model's performance. Furthermore, the LLM-based deidentification method 
      was a feasible and appealing approach that can be controlled and enhanced through 
      natural language prompts. CONCLUSIONS: The study contributes to understanding the 
      underlying mechanism of PLMs in addressing the deidentification process in the 
      code-mixed context and highlights the significance of incorporating code-mixed 
      training instances into the model training phase. To support the advancement of 
      research, we created a manipulated subset of the resynthesized data set available 
      for research purposes. Based on the compiled data set, we found that the 
      LLM-based deidentification method is a feasible approach, but carefully crafted 
      prompts are essential to avoid unwanted output. However, the use of such methods 
      in the hospital setting requires careful consideration of data security and 
      privacy concerns. Further research could explore the augmentation of PLMs and 
      LLMs with external knowledge to improve their strength in recognizing rare PHI.

AB  - Central hypoventilation syndrome (CHS) is a rare condition resulting from damage 
      to the respiratory centers in the central nervous system (CNS). It can be 
      congenital or acquired and can cause hypoventilation, inadequate gas exchange, 
      and respiratory failure, often during sleep but sometimes even while awake. CHS 
      can lead to respiratory failure and life-threatening complications if not 
      identified promptly. In this report, we present a rare case of a patient with 
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), who 
      developed CHS likely due to an opportunistic infection by cytomegalovirus (CMV) 
      and varicella zoster virus (VZV), manifesting as a lesion in the medullary 
      respiratory nuclei. After treatment with ganciclovir, the patient showed clinical 
      improvement, and his medullary lesion resolved.

AB  - Research into the potential benefits of artificial intelligence for comprehending 
      the intricate biology of cancer has grown as a result of the widespread use of 
      deep learning and machine learning in the healthcare sector and the availability 
      of highly specialized cancer datasets. Here, we review new artificial 
      intelligence approaches and how they are being used in oncology. We describe how 
      artificial intelligence might be used in the detection, prognosis, and 
      administration of cancer treatments and introduce the use of the latest large 
      language models such as ChatGPT in oncology clinics. We highlight artificial 
      intelligence applications for omics data types, and we offer perspectives on how 
      the various data types might be combined to create decision-support tools. We

TI  - EVLncRNAs 3.0: an updated comprehensive database for manually curated functional 
      long non-coding RNAs validated by low-throughput experiments.
PG  - D98-D106
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkad1057 [doi]
AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as crucial regulators across diverse 
      biological processes and diseases. While high-throughput sequencing has enabled 
      lncRNA discovery, functional characterization remains limited. The EVLncRNAs 
      database is the first and exclusive repository for all experimentally validated 
      functional lncRNAs from various species. After previous releases in 2018 and 
      2021, this update marks a major expansion through exhaustive manual curation of 
      nearly 25&nbsp;000 publications from 15&nbsp;May 2020, to 15&nbsp;May 2023. It incorporates 
      substantial growth across all categories: a 154% increase in functional lncRNAs, 
      160% in associated diseases, 186% in lncRNA-disease associations, 235% in 
      interactions, 138% in structures, 234% in circular RNAs, 235% in resistant 
      lncRNAs&nbsp;and 4724% in exosomal lncRNAs. More importantly, it incorporated 
      additional information include functional classifications, detailed interaction 
      pathways, homologous lncRNAs, lncRNA locations, COVID-19, phase-separation and 
      organoid-related lncRNAs. The web interface was substantially improved for 
      browsing, visualization, and searching. ChatGPT was tested for information 
      extraction and functional overview with its limitation noted. EVLncRNAs 3.0 
      represents the most extensive curated resource of experimentally validated 
      functional lncRNAs and will serve as an indispensable platform for unravelling 
      emerging lncRNA functions. The updated database is freely available at

TI  - Accuracy of an Artificial Intelligence Chatbot's Interpretation of Clinical 
      Ophthalmic Images.
LID - 10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2024.0017 [doi]
LID - e240017
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Ophthalmology is reliant on effective interpretation of multimodal 
      imaging to ensure diagnostic accuracy. The new ability of ChatGPT-4 (OpenAI) to 
      interpret ophthalmic images has not yet been explored. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the 
      performance of the novel release of an artificial intelligence chatbot that is 
      capable of processing imaging data. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 
      cross-sectional study used a publicly available dataset of ophthalmic cases from 
      OCTCases, a medical education platform based out of the Department of 
      Ophthalmology and Vision Sciences at the University of Toronto, with accompanying 
      clinical multimodal imaging and multiple-choice questions. Across 137 available 
      cases, 136 contained multiple-choice questions (99%). EXPOSURES: The chatbot 
      answered questions requiring multimodal input from October 16 to October 23, 
      2023. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the accuracy of the 
      chatbot in answering multiple-choice questions pertaining to image recognition in 
      ophthalmic cases, measured as the proportion of correct responses. Ï2 Tests were 
      conducted to compare the proportion of correct responses across different 
      ophthalmic subspecialties. RESULTS: A total of 429 multiple-choice questions from 
      136 ophthalmic cases and 448 images were included in the analysis. The chatbot 
      answered 299 of multiple-choice questions correctly across all cases (70%). The 
      chatbot's performance was better on retina questions than neuro-ophthalmology 
      questions (77% vs 58%; differenceâ=â18%; 95% CI, 7.5%-29.4%; Ï21â=â11.4; 
      Pâ&lt;â.001). The chatbot achieved a better performance on nonimage-based questions 
      compared with image-based questions (82% vs 65%; differenceâ=â17%; 95% CI, 
      7.8%-25.1%; Ï21â=â12.2; Pâ&lt;â.001).The chatbot performed best on questions in the 
      retina category (77% correct) and poorest in the neuro-ophthalmology category 
      (58% correct). The chatbot demonstrated intermediate performance on questions 
      from the ocular oncology (72% correct), pediatric ophthalmology (68% correct), 
      uveitis (67% correct), and glaucoma (61% correct) categories. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: In this study, the recent version of the chatbot accurately responded 
      to approximately two-thirds of multiple-choice questions pertaining to ophthalmic 
      cases based on imaging interpretation. The multimodal chatbot performed better on 
      questions that did not rely on the interpretation of imaging modalities. As the 
      use of multimodal chatbots becomes increasingly widespread, it is imperative to 
      stress their appropriate integration within medical contexts.

TI  - Quality of Large Language Model Responses to Radiation Oncology Patient Care 
      Questions.
PG  - e244630
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.4630 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Artificial intelligence (AI) large language models (LLMs) demonstrate 
      potential in simulating human-like dialogue. Their efficacy in accurate 
      patient-clinician communication within radiation oncology has yet to be explored. 
      OBJECTIVE: To determine an LLM's quality of responses to radiation oncology 
      patient care questions using both domain-specific expertise and domain-agnostic 
      metrics. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study retrieved 
      questions and answers from websites (accessed February 1 to March 20, 2023) 
      affiliated with the National Cancer Institute and the Radiological Society of 
      North America. These questions were used as queries for an AI LLM, ChatGPT 
      version 3.5 (accessed February 20 to April 20, 2023), to prompt LLM-generated 
      responses. Three radiation oncologists and 3 radiation physicists ranked the 
      LLM-generated responses for relative factual correctness, relative completeness, 
      and relative conciseness compared with online expert answers. Statistical 
      analysis was performed from July to October 2023. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The 
      LLM's responses were ranked by experts using domain-specific metrics such as 
      relative correctness, conciseness, completeness, and potential harm compared with 
      online expert answers on a 5-point Likert scale. Domain-agnostic metrics 
      encompassing cosine similarity scores, readability scores, word count, lexicon, 
      and syllable counts were computed as independent quality checks for LLM-generated 
      responses. RESULTS: Of the 115 radiation oncology questions retrieved from 4 
      professional society websites, the LLM performed the same or better in 108 
      responses (94%) for relative correctness, 89 responses (77%) for completeness, 
      and 105 responses (91%) for conciseness compared with expert answers. Only 2 LLM 
      responses were ranked as having potential harm. The mean (SD) readability 
      consensus score for expert answers was 10.63 (3.17) vs 13.64 (2.22) for LLM 
      answers (Pâ&lt;â.001), indicating 10th grade and college reading levels, 
      respectively. The mean (SD) number of syllables was 327.35 (277.15) for expert vs 
      376.21 (107.89) for LLM answers (Pâ=â.07), the mean (SD) word count was 226.33 
      (191.92) for expert vs 246.26 (69.36) for LLM answers (Pâ=â.27), and the mean 
      (SD) lexicon score was 200.15 (171.28) for expert vs 219.10 (61.59) for LLM 
      answers (Pâ=â.24). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, the 
      LLM generated accurate, comprehensive, and concise responses with minimal risk of 
      harm, using language similar to human experts but at a higher reading level. 
      These findings suggest the LLM's potential, with some retraining, as a valuable 
      resource for patient queries in radiation oncology and other medical fields.

AB  - In drug discovery, targeted polypharmacology, i.e., targeting multiple molecular 
      targets with a single drug, is redefining therapeutic design to address complex 
      diseases. Pre-selected pharmacological profiles, as exemplified in kinase drugs, 
      promise enhanced efficacy and reduced toxicity. Historically, many of such drugs 
      were discovered serendipitously, limiting predictability and efficacy, but 
      currently artificial intelligence (AI) offers a transformative solution. Machine 
      learning and deep learning techniques enable modeling protein structures, 
      generating novel compounds, and decoding their polypharmacological effects, 
      opening an avenue for more systematic and predictive multi-target drug design. 
      This review explores the use of AI in identifying synergistic co-targets and 
      delineating them from anti-targets that lead to adverse effects, and then 
      discusses advances in AI-enabled docking, generative chemistry, and 
      proteochemometric modeling of proteome-wide compound interactions, in the context 
      of polypharmacology. We also provide insights into challenges ahead.

TI  - Enhancing Kidney Transplant Care through the Integration of Chatbot.
LID - 10.3390/healthcare11182518 [doi]
LID - 2518
AB  - Kidney transplantation is a critical treatment option for end-stage kidney 
      disease patients, offering improved quality of life and increased survival rates. 
      However, the complexities of kidney transplant care necessitate continuous 
      advancements in decision making, patient communication, and operational 
      efficiency. This article explores the potential integration of a sophisticated 
      chatbot, an AI-powered conversational agent, to enhance kidney transplant 
      practice and potentially improve patient outcomes. Chatbots and generative AI 
      have shown promising applications in various domains, including healthcare, by 
      simulating human-like interactions and generating contextually appropriate 
      responses. Noteworthy AI models like ChatGPT by OpenAI, BingChat by Microsoft, 
      and Bard AI by Google exhibit significant potential in supporting evidence-based 
      research and healthcare decision making. The integration of chatbots in kidney 
      transplant care may offer transformative possibilities. As a clinical decision 
      support tool, it could provide healthcare professionals with real-time access to 
      medical literature and guidelines, potentially enabling informed decision making 
      and improved knowledge dissemination. Additionally, the chatbot has the potential 
      to facilitate patient education by offering personalized and understandable 
      information, addressing queries, and providing guidance on post-transplant care. 
      Furthermore, under clinician or transplant pharmacist supervision, it has the 
      potential to support post-transplant care and medication management by analyzing 
      patient data, which may lead to tailored recommendations on dosages, monitoring 
      schedules, and potential drug interactions. However, to fully ascertain its 
      effectiveness and safety in these roles, further studies and validation are 
      required. Its integration with existing clinical decision support systems may 
      enhance risk stratification and treatment planning, contributing to more informed 
      and efficient decision making in kidney transplant care. Given the importance of 
      ethical considerations and bias mitigation in AI integration, future studies may 
      evaluate long-term patient outcomes, cost-effectiveness, user experience, and the 
      generalizability of chatbot recommendations. By addressing these factors and 
      potentially leveraging AI capabilities, the integration of chatbots in kidney 
      transplant care holds promise for potentially improving patient outcomes, 
      enhancing decision making, and fostering the equitable and responsible use of AI 
      in healthcare.

TI  - Assessment of Artificial Intelligence Chatbot Responses to Top Searched Queries 
      About Cancer.
PG  - 1437-1440
LID - 10.1001/jamaoncol.2023.2947 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Consumers are increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) 
      chatbots as a source of information. However, the quality of the cancer 
      information generated by these chatbots has not yet been evaluated using 
      validated instruments. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the quality of information and 
      presence of misinformation about skin, lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate 
      cancers generated by 4 AI chatbots. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 
      cross-sectional study assessed AI chatbots' text responses to the 5 most commonly 
      searched queries related to the 5 most common cancers using validated 
      instruments. Search data were extracted from the publicly available Google Trends 
      platform and identical prompts were used to generate responses from 4 AI 
      chatbots: ChatGPT version 3.5 (OpenAI), Perplexity (Perplexity.AI), Chatsonic 
      (Writesonic), and Bing AI (Microsoft). EXPOSURES: Google Trends' top 5 search 
      queries related to skin, lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer from 
      January 1, 2021, to January 1, 2023, were input into 4 AI chatbots. MAIN OUTCOMES 
      AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were the quality of consumer health 
      information based on the validated DISCERN instrument (scores from 1 [low] to 5 
      [high] for quality of information) and the understandability and actionability of 
      this information based on the understandability and actionability domains of the 
      Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT) (scores of 0%-100%, with 
      higher scores indicating a higher level of understandability and actionability). 
      Secondary outcomes included misinformation scored using a 5-item Likert scale 
      (scores from 1 [no misinformation] to 5 [high misinformation]) and readability 
      assessed using the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level readability score. RESULTS: The 
      analysis included 100 responses from 4 chatbots about the 5 most common search 
      queries for skin, lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer. The quality of 
      text responses generated by the 4 AI chatbots was good (median [range] DISCERN 
      score, 5 [2-5]) and no misinformation was identified. Understandability was 
      moderate (median [range] PEMAT Understandability score, 66.7% [33.3%-90.1%]), and 
      actionability was poor (median [range] PEMAT Actionability score, 20.0% 
      [0%-40.0%]). The responses were written at the college level based on the 
      Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level score. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Findings of this 
      cross-sectional study suggest that AI chatbots generally produce accurate 
      information for the top cancer-related search queries, but the responses are not 
      readily actionable and are written at a college reading level. These limitations 
      suggest that AI chatbots should be used supplementarily and not as a primary 
      source for medical information.

TI  - Laser Treatment for Patients With Vulvodynia and Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder 
      Pain Syndrome: A Case Series (The UNICORN-3 Study).
PG  - e41786
LID - 10.7759/cureus.41786 [doi]
LID - e41786
AB  - Introduction Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is a chronic 
      pain disorder characterized by urgency, frequency of urination, and pelvic pain. 
      Women with IC/BPS often experience sexual dysfunction, vulvodynia, and vaginal 
      health issues. Combined erbium and neodymium yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) laser 
      treatments targeting the vagina and vulva have shown promise in improving 
      symptoms. Our study aims to investigate the effectiveness of these combined laser 
      treatments in women with IC/BPS and vulvodynia. Methods Women diagnosed with 
      vulvodynia and IC/BPS underwent combined laser treatment using vaginal erbium:YAG 
      laser (VEL) and neodymium:YAG laser (Nd:YAG). Various parameters were evaluated, 
      including the vulvodynia test, numeric rating scale (NRS-11) for pain, 
      interstitial cystitis symptom index and problem index (ICSI and ICPI), pelvic 
      pain&nbsp;and urgency/frequency symptom score (PUF), and mean urination volume/daily 
      urination frequency in a three-day urination diary. Treatment was administered 
      three times, with intervals of one month between each session, and follow-up 
      evaluations were conducted at six and 12 months. All statistical analyses were 
      designed and programmed by the AI chatbot GPT-4 (chatGPT-4). Results Fifteen 
      female patients diagnosed with vulvodynia and IC/BPS were treated with three 
      sessions of VEL + Nd:YAG. Significant improvements were observed in the 
      vulvodynia test, NRS-11 scores, PUF, ICSI scores, ICPI scores, mean urination 
      volume, and daily urination frequency at six and 12 months (p&lt;0.01). Short-term 
      improvements in IC/BPS pain scores correlated with improvements in the vulvodynia 
      test (p=0.007), suggesting a synergistic effect. However, no significant 
      correlations were found at 12 months. Conclusion Combined laser treatments 
      targeting the vagina and vulva showed significant therapeutic effects in women 
      with IC/BPS and vulvodynia. The addition of Nd:YAG to the VEL treatment enhanced 
      outcomes. Short-term improvements in IC/BPS pain scores correlated with 
      improvements in the vulvodynia test, indicating a synergistic effect. Long-term 
      improvements in both vulvodynia and IC/BPS symptoms may occur 
      independently.&nbsp;These findings highlight the importance of comprehensive 
      approaches for treating coexisting vulvodynia and IC/BPS.

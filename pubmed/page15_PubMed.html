TI  - Evaluating large language models on medical evidence summarization.
PG  - 158
LID - 10.1038/s41746-023-00896-7 [doi]
LID - 158
AB  - Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable 
      successes in zero- and few-shot performance on various downstream tasks, paving 
      the way for applications in high-stakes domains. In this study, we systematically 
      examine the capabilities and limitations of LLMs, specifically GPT-3.5 and 
      ChatGPT, in performing zero-shot medical evidence summarization across six 
      clinical domains. We conduct both automatic and human evaluations, covering 
      several dimensions of summary quality. Our study demonstrates that automatic 
      metrics often do not strongly correlate with the quality of summaries. 
      Furthermore, informed by our human evaluations, we define a terminology of error 
      types for medical evidence summarization. Our findings reveal that LLMs could be 
      susceptible to generating factually inconsistent summaries and making overly 
      convincing or uncertain statements, leading to potential harm due to 
      misinformation. Moreover, we find that models struggle to identify the salient 
      information and are more error-prone when summarizing over longer textual 
      contexts.

TI  - Feasibility of Using the Privacy-preserving Large Language Model Vicuna for 
      Labeling Radiology Reports.
PG  - e231147
LID - 10.1148/radiol.231147 [doi]
LID - e231147
AB  - Background Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, though proficient in 
      many text-based tasks, are not suitable for use with radiology reports due to 
      patient privacy constraints. Purpose To test the feasibility of using an 
      alternative LLM (Vicuna-13B) that can be run locally for labeling radiography 
      reports. Materials and Methods Chest radiography reports from the MIMIC-CXR and 
      National Institutes of Health (NIH) data sets were included in this retrospective 
      study. Reports were examined for 13 findings. Outputs reporting the presence or 
      absence of the 13 findings were generated by Vicuna by using a single-step or 
      multistep prompting strategy (prompts 1 and 2, respectively). Agreements between 
      Vicuna outputs and CheXpert and CheXbert labelers were assessed using Fleiss Îº. 
      Agreement between Vicuna outputs from three runs under a hyperparameter setting 
      that introduced some randomness (temperature, 0.7) was also assessed. The 
      performance of Vicuna and the labelers was assessed in a subset of 100 NIH 
      reports annotated by a radiologist with use of area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve (AUC). Results A total of 3269 reports from the MIMIC-CXR 
      data set (median patient age, 68 years [IQR, 59-79 years]; 161 male patients) and 
      25â596 reports from the NIH data set (median patient age, 47 years [IQR, 32-58 
      years]; 1557 male patients) were included. Vicuna outputs with prompt 2 showed, 
      on average, moderate to substantial agreement with the labelers on the MIMIC-CXR 
      (Îº median, 0.57 [IQR, 0.45-0.66] with CheXpert and 0.64 [IQR, 0.45-0.68] with 
      CheXbert) and NIH (Îº median, 0.52 [IQR, 0.41-0.65] with CheXpert and 0.55 [IQR, 
      0.41-0.74] with CheXbert) data sets, respectively. Vicuna with prompt 2 performed 
      at par (median AUC, 0.84 [IQR, 0.74-0.93]) with both labelers on nine of 11 
      findings. Conclusion In this proof-of-concept study, outputs of the LLM Vicuna 
      reporting the presence or absence of 13 findings on chest radiography reports 
      showed moderate to substantial agreement with existing labelers. Â© RSNA, 2023

TI  - Arf6 Regulates Endocytosis and Angiogenesis by Promoting Filamentous Actin 
      Assembly.
LID - 2023.02.22.529543 [pii]
LID - 10.1101/2023.02.22.529543 [doi]
AB  - Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is a process vital to angiogenesis as well as 
      general vascular homeostasis. In pathologies where supraphysiological growth 
      factor signaling underlies disease etiology, such as in diabetic retinopathy and 
      solid tumors, strategies to limit chronic growth factor signaling by way of CME 
      have been shown to have tremendous clinical value. ADP ribosylation factor 6 
      (Arf6) is a small GTPase that promotes the assembly of actin necessary for CME. 
      In its absence, growth factor signaling is greatly diminished, which has been 
      shown to ameliorate pathological signaling input in diseased vasculature. 
      However, it is less clear if there are bystander effects related to loss of Arf6 
      on angiogenic behaviors. Our goal was to provide a analysis of Arf6Ã¢â¬â¢s function 
      in angiogenic endothelium, focusing on its role in lumenogenesis as well as its 
      relation to actin and CME. We found that Arf6 localized to both filamentous actin 
      and sites of CME in 2-dimensional culture. Loss of Arf6 distorted both apicobasal 
      polarity and reduced the total cellular filamentous actin content, and this may 
      be the primary driver underlying gross dysmorphogenesis during angiogenic 
      sprouting in its absence. Our findings highlight that endothelial Arf6 is a 
      potent mediator of both actin regulation and CME.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The increasing pressure to publish research has led to a rise in 
      plagiarism incidents, creating a need for effective plagiarism detection 
      software. The importance of this study lies in the high cost variation amongst 
      the available options for plagiarism detection. By uncovering the advantages of 
      these low-cost or free alternatives, researchers could access the appropriate 
      tools for plagiarism detection. This is the first study to compare four 
      plagiarism detection tools and assess factors impacting their effectiveness in 
      identifying plagiarism in AI-generated articles. METHODOLOGY: A prospective 
      cross-over study was conducted with the primary objective to compare Overall 
      Similarity Index(OSI) of four plagiarism detection software(iThenticate, 
      Grammarly, Small SEO Tools, and DupliChecker) on AI-generated articles. ChatGPT 
      was used to generate 100 articles, ten from each of ten general domains affecting 
      various aspects of life. These were run through four software, recording the OSI. 
      Flesch Reading Ease Score(FRES), Gunning Fog Index(GFI), and Flesch-Kincaid Grade 
      Level(FKGL) were used to assess how factors, such as article length and language 
      complexity, impact plagiarism detection. RESULTS: The study found significant 
      variation in OSI(p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.001) among the four software, with Grammarly having the 
      highest mean rank(3.56) and Small SEO Tools having the lowest(1.67). Pairwise 
      analyses revealed significant differences(p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.001) between all pairs except for 
      Small SEO Tools-DupliChecker. Number of words showed a significant correlation 
      with OSI for iThenticate(p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05) but not for the other three. FRES had a 
      positive correlation, and GFI had a negative correlation with OSI by 
      DupliChecker. FKGL negatively correlated with OSI by Small SEO Tools and 
      DupliChecker. CONCLUSION: Grammarly is unexpectedly most effective in detecting 
      plagiarism in AI-generated articles compared to the other tools. This could be 
      due to different softwares using diverse data sources. This highlights the 
      potential for lower-cost plagiarism detection tools to be utilized by 
      researchers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients are increasingly using Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 
      (GPT-4) to better understand their own radiology findings. PURPOSE: To evaluate 
      the performance of GPT-4 in transforming cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) 
      reports into text that is comprehensible to medical laypersons. METHODS: ChatGPT 
      with GPT-4 architecture was used to generate three different explained versions 
      of 20 various CMR reports (n = 60) using the same prompt: "Explain the radiology 
      report in a language understandable to a medical layperson". Two cardiovascular 
      radiologists evaluated understandability, factual correctness, completeness of 
      relevant findings, and lack of potential harm, while 13 medical laypersons 
      evaluated the understandability of the original and the GPT-4 reports on a Likert 
      scale (1 "strongly disagree", 5 "strongly agree"). Readability was measured using 
      the Automated Readability Index (ARI). Linear mixed-effects models (values given 
      as median [interquartile range]) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 
      were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: GPT-4 reports were generated on 
      average in 52&nbsp;s&nbsp;Â±&nbsp;13. GPT-4 reports achieved a lower ARI score (10 [9-12] vs 5 
      [4-6]; p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.001) and were subjectively easier to understand for laypersons than 
      original reports (1 [1] vs 4 [4,5]; p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.001). Eighteen out of 20 (90%) standard 
      CMR reports and 2/60 (3%) GPT-generated reports had an ARI score corresponding to 
      the 8th grade level or higher. Radiologists' ratings of the GPT-4 reports reached 
      high levels for correctness (5 [4, 5]), completeness (5 [5]), and lack of 
      potential harm (5 [5]); with "strong agreement" for factual correctness in 94% 
      (113/120) and completeness of relevant findings in 81% (97/120) of reports. 
      Test-retest agreement for layperson understandability ratings between the three 
      simplified reports generated from the same original report was substantial (ICC: 
      0.62; p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.001). Interrater agreement between radiologists was almost perfect 
      for lack of potential harm (ICC: 0.93, p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.001) and moderate to substantial for 
      completeness (ICC: 0.76, p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.001) and factual correctness (ICC: 0.55, 
      p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.001). CONCLUSION: GPT-4 can reliably transform complex CMR reports into 
      more understandable, layperson-friendly language while largely maintaining 
      factual correctness and completeness, and can thus help convey patient-relevant 
      radiology information in an easy-to-understand manner.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of a commercially available Generative 
      Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) in describing and establishing differential 
      diagnoses for radiolucent lesions in panoramic radiographs. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Twenty-eight panoramic radiographs, each containing a single radiolucent 
      lesion, were evaluated in consensus by three examiners and a commercially 
      available ChatGPT-3.5 model. They provided descriptions regarding internal 
      structure (radiodensity, loculation), periphery (margin type, cortication), 
      shape, location (bone, side, region, teeth/structures), and effects on adjacent 
      structures (effect, adjacent structure). Diagnostic impressions related to 
      origin, behavior, and nature were also provided. The GPT program was additionally 
      prompted to provide differential diagnoses. Keywords used by the GPT program were 
      compared to those used by the examiners and scored as 0 (incorrect), 0.5 
      (partially correct), or 1 (correct). Mean score values and standard deviation 
      were calculated for each description. Performance in establishing differential 
      diagnoses was assessed using Rank-1, -2, and -â3. RESULTS: Descriptions of 
      margination, affected bone, and origin received the highest scores: 0.93, 0.93, 
      and 0.87, respectively. Shape, region, teeth/structures, effect, affected region, 
      and nature received considerably lower scores ranging from 0.22 to 0.50. Rank-1, 
      -2, and -â3 demonstrated accuracy in 25%, 57.14%, and 67.85% of cases, 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: The performance of the GPT program in describing and 
      providing differential diagnoses for radiolucent lesions in panoramic radiographs 
      is variable and at this stage limited in its use for clinical application. 
      CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Understanding the potential role of GPT systems as an 
      auxiliary tool in image interpretation is imperative to validate their clinical 
      applicability.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Regular physical activity is critical for health and disease 
      prevention. Yet, health care providers and patients face barriers to implement 
      evidence-based lifestyle recommendations. The potential to augment care with the 
      increased availability of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies is limitless; 
      however, the suitability of AI-generated exercise recommendations has yet to be 
      explored. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the 
      comprehensiveness, accuracy, and readability of individualized exercise 
      recommendations generated by a novel AI chatbot. METHODS: A coding scheme was 
      developed to score AI-generated exercise recommendations across ten categories 
      informed by gold-standard exercise recommendations, including (1) health 
      condition-specific benefits of exercise, (2) exercise preparticipation health 
      screening, (3) frequency, (4) intensity, (5) time, (6) type, (7) volume, (8) 
      progression, (9) special considerations, and (10) references to the primary 
      literature. The AI chatbot was prompted to provide individualized exercise 
      recommendations for 26 clinical populations using an open-source application 
      programming interface. Two independent reviewers coded AI-generated content for 
      each category and calculated comprehensiveness (%) and factual accuracy (%) on a 
      scale of 0%-100%. Readability was assessed using the Flesch-Kincaid formula. 
      Qualitative analysis identified and categorized themes from AI-generated output. 
      RESULTS: AI-generated exercise recommendations were 41.2% (107/260) comprehensive 
      and 90.7% (146/161) accurate, with the majority (8/15, 53%) of inaccuracy related 
      to the need for exercise preparticipation medical clearance. Average readability 
      level of AI-generated exercise recommendations was at the college level (mean 
      13.7, SD 1.7), with an average Flesch reading ease score of 31.1 (SD 7.7). 
      Several recurring themes and observations of AI-generated output included concern 
      for liability and safety, preference for aerobic exercise, and potential bias and 
      direct discrimination against certain age-based populations and individuals with 
      disabilities. CONCLUSIONS: There were notable gaps in the comprehensiveness, 
      accuracy, and readability of AI-generated exercise recommendations. Exercise and 
      health care professionals should be aware of these limitations when using and 
      endorsing AI-based technologies as a tool to support lifestyle change involving 
      exercise.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Clinical deep phenotyping and phenotype annotation play a critical 
      role in both the diagnosis of patients with rare disorders as well as in building 
      computationally-tractable knowledge in the rare disorders field. These processes 
      rely on using ontology concepts, often from the Human Phenotype Ontology, in 
      conjunction with a phenotype concept recognition task (supported usually by 
      machine learning methods) to curate patient profiles or existing scientific 
      literature. With the significant shift in the use of large language models (LLMs) 
      for most NLP tasks, we examine the performance of the latest Generative 
      Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models underpinning ChatGPT as a foundation for the 
      tasks of clinical phenotyping and phenotype annotation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      The experimental setup of the study included seven prompts of various levels of 
      specificity, two GPT models (gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4.0) and two established gold 
      standard corpora for phenotype recognition, one consisting of publication 
      abstracts and the other clinical observations. RESULTS: The best run, using 
      in-context learning, achieved 0.58 document-level F1 score on publication 
      abstracts and 0.75 document-level F1 score on clinical observations, as well as a 
      mention-level F1 score of 0.7, which surpasses the current best in class tool. 
      Without in-context learning, however, performance is significantly below the 
      existing approaches. CONCLUSION: Our experiments show that gpt-4.0 surpasses the 
      state of the art performance if the task is constrained to a subset of the target 
      ontology where there is prior knowledge of the terms that are expected to be 
      matched. While the results are promising, the non-deterministic nature of the 
      outcomes, the high cost and the lack of concordance between different runs using 
      the same prompt and input make the use of these LLMs challenging for this 
      particular task.

TI  - Increasing physical activity using an just-in-time adaptive digital assistant 
      supported by machine learning: A novel approach for hyper-personalised mHealth 
      interventions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Physical inactivity is a leading modifiable cause of death and disease 
      worldwide. Population-based interventions to increase physical activity are 
      needed. Existing automated expert systems (e.g., computer-tailored interventions) 
      have significant limitations that result in low long-term effectiveness. 
      Therefore, innovative approaches are needed. This special communication aims to 
      describe and discuss a novel mHealth intervention approach that proactively 
      offers participants with hyper-personalised intervention content adjusted in 
      real-time. METHODS: Using machine learning approaches, we propose a novel 
      physical activity intervention approach that can learn and adapt in real-time to 
      achieve high levels of personalisation and user engagement, underpinned by a 
      likeable digital assistant. It will consist of three major components: (1) 
      conversations: to increase user's knowledge on a wide range of activity-related 
      topics underpinned by Natural Language Processing; (2) nudge engine: to provide 
      users with hyper-personalised cues to action underpinned by reinforcement 
      learning (i.e., contextual bandit) and integrating real-time data from activity 
      tracking, GPS, GIS, weather, and user provided data; (3) Q&amp;A: to facilitate users 
      asking any physical activity related questions underpinned by generative AI 
      (e.g., ChatGPT, Bard) for content generation. RESULTS: The detailed concept of 
      the proposed physical activity intervention platform demonstrates the practical 
      application of a just-in-time adaptive intervention applying various machine 
      learning techniques to deliver a hyper-personalised physical activity 
      intervention in an engaging way. Compared to traditional interventions, the novel 
      platform is expected to show potential for increased user engagement and 
      long-term effectiveness due to: (1) using new variables to personalise content 
      (e.g., GPS, weather), (2) providing behavioural support at the right time in 
      real-time, (3) implementing an engaging digital assistant and (4) improving the 
      relevance of content through applying machine learning algorithms. CONCLUSION: 
      The use of machine learning is on the rise in every aspect of today's society, 
      however few attempts have been undertaken to harness its potential to achieve 
      health behaviour change. By sharing our intervention concept, we contribute to 
      the ongoing dialogue on creating effective methods for promoting health and 
      well-being in the informatics research community. Future research should focus on 
      refining these techniques and evaluating their effectiveness in controlled and 
      real-world circumstances.

TI  - A Preliminary Checklist (METRICS) to Standardize the Design and Reporting of 
      Studies on Generative Artificial Intelligence-Based Models in Health Care 
      Education and Practice: Development Study Involving a Literature Review.
PG  - e54704

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adherence to evidence-based practice is indispensable in health care. 
      Recently, the utility of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models in health 
      care has been evaluated extensively. However, the lack of consensus guidelines on 
      the design and reporting of findings of these studies poses a challenge for the 
      interpretation and synthesis of evidence. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop 
      a preliminary checklist to standardize the reporting of generative AI-based 
      studies in health care education and practice. METHODS: A literature review was 
      conducted in Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Published records with 
      "ChatGPT," "Bing," or "Bard" in the title were retrieved. Careful examination of 
      the methodologies employed in the included records was conducted to identify the 
      common pertinent themes and the possible gaps in reporting. A panel discussion 
      was held to establish a unified and thorough checklist for the reporting of AI 
      studies in health care. The finalized checklist was used to evaluate the included 
      records by 2 independent raters. Cohen Îº was used as the method to evaluate the 
      interrater reliability. RESULTS: The final data set that formed the basis for 
      pertinent theme identification and analysis comprised a total of 34 records. The 
      finalized checklist included 9 pertinent themes collectively referred to as 
      METRICS (Model, Evaluation, Timing, Range/Randomization, Individual factors, 
      Count, and Specificity of prompts and language). Their details are as follows: 
      (1) Model used and its exact settings; (2) Evaluation approach for the generated 
      content; (3) Timing of testing the model; (4) Transparency of the data source; 
      (5) Range of tested topics; (6) Randomization of selecting the queries; (7) 
      Individual factors in selecting the queries and interrater reliability; (8) Count 
      of queries executed to test the model; and (9) Specificity of the prompts and 
      language used. The overall mean METRICS score was 3.0 (SD 0.58). The tested 
      METRICS score was acceptable, with the range of Cohen Îº of 0.558 to 0.962 (P&lt;.001 
      for the 9 tested items). With classification per item, the highest average 
      METRICS score was recorded for the "Model" item, followed by the "Specificity" 
      item, while the lowest scores were recorded for the "Randomization" item 
      (classified as suboptimal) and "Individual factors" item (classified as 
      satisfactory). CONCLUSIONS: The METRICS checklist can facilitate the design of 
      studies guiding researchers toward best practices in reporting results. The 
      findings highlight the need for standardized reporting algorithms for generative 
      AI-based studies in health care, considering the variability observed in 
      methodologies and reporting. The proposed METRICS checklist could be a 
      preliminary helpful base to establish a universally accepted approach to 
      standardize the design and reporting of generative AI-based studies in health 
      care, which is a swiftly evolving research topic.

AB  - The remarkable performance of ChatGPT, launched in November 2022, has 
      significantly impacted the field of natural language processing, inspiring the 
      application of large language models as supportive tools in clinical practice and 
      research worldwide. Although GPT-3.5 recently scored high on the United States 
      Medical Licensing Examination, its performance on medical licensing examinations 
      of other nations, especially non-English speaking nations, has not been 
      sufficiently evaluated. This study assessed GPT's performance on the National 
      Medical Licensing Examination (NMLE) in Japan and compared it with the actual 
      minimal passing rate for this exam. In particular, the performances of both the 
      GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models were considered for the comparative analysis. We 
      initially used the GPT models and several prompts for 290 questions without image 
      data from the 116th NMLE (held in February 2022 in Japan) to maximize the 
      performance for delivering correct answers and explanations of the questions. 
      Thereafter, we tested the performance of the best GPT model (GPT-4) with 
      optimized prompts on a dataset of 262 questions without images from the latest 
      117th NMLE (held in February 2023). The best model with the optimized prompts 
      scored 82.7% for the essential questions and 77.2% for the basic and clinical 
      questions, both of which sufficed the minimum passing scoring rates of 80.0% and 
      74.6%, respectively. After an exploratory analysis of 56 incorrect answers from 
      the model, we identified the three major factors contributing to the generation 
      of the incorrect answers-insufficient medical knowledge, information on 
      Japan-specific medical system and guidelines, and mathematical errors. In 
      conclusion, GPT-4 with our optimized prompts achieved a minimum passing scoring 
      rate in the latest 117th NMLE in Japan. Beyond its original design of answering 
      examination questions for humans, these artificial intelligence (AI) models can 
      serve as one of the best "sidekicks" for solving problems and addressing the 
      unmet needs in the medical and healthcare fields.

AB  - There are enormous enthusiasm and concerns in applying large language models 
      (LLMs) to healthcare. Yet current assumptions are based on general-purpose LLMs 
      such as ChatGPT, which are not developed for medical use. This study develops a 
      generative clinical LLM, GatorTronGPT, using 277 billion words of text including 
      (1) 82 billion words of clinical text from 126 clinical departments and 
      approximately 2 million patients at the University of Florida Health and (2) 195 
      billion words of diverse general English text. We train GatorTronGPT using a 
      GPT-3 architecture with up to 20 billion parameters and evaluate its utility for 
      biomedical natural language processing (NLP) and healthcare text generation. 
      GatorTronGPT improves biomedical natural language processing. We apply 
      GatorTronGPT to generate 20 billion words of synthetic text. Synthetic NLP models 
      trained using synthetic text generated by GatorTronGPT outperform models trained 
      using real-world clinical text. Physicians' Turing test using 1 (worst) to 9 
      (best) scale shows that there are no significant differences in linguistic 
      readability (pâ=â0.22; 6.57 of GatorTronGPT compared with 6.93 of human) and 
      clinical relevance (pâ=â0.91; 7.0 of GatorTronGPT compared with 6.97 of human) 
      and that physicians cannot differentiate them (pâ&lt;â0.001). This study provides 
      insights into the opportunities and challenges of LLMs for medical research and 
      healthcare.

TI  - Adequacy of prostate cancer prevention and screening recommendations provided by 
      an artificial intelligence-powered large language model.
LID - 10.1007/s11255-024-04009-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We aimed to assess the appropriateness of ChatGPT in providing answers 
      related to prostate cancer (PCa) screening, comparing GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. METHODS: 
      A committee of five reviewers designed 30 questions related to PCa screening, 
      categorized into three difficulty levels. The questions were formulated 
      identically for both GPTs three times, varying the prompts. Each reviewer 
      assigned a score for accuracy, clarity, and conciseness. The readability was 
      assessed by the Flesch Kincaid Grade (FKG) and Flesch Reading Ease (FRE). The 
      mean scores were extracted and compared using the Wilcoxon test. We compared the 
      readability across the three different prompts by ANOVA. RESULTS: In GPT-3.5 the 
      mean score (SD) for accuracy, clarity, and conciseness was 1.5 (0.59), 1.7 
      (0.45), 1.7 (0.49), respectively for easy questions; 1.3 (0.67), 1.6 (0.69), 1.3 
      (0.65) for medium; 1.3 (0.62), 1.6 (0.56), 1.4 (0.56) for hard. In GPT-4 was 2.0 
      (0), 2.0 (0), 2.0 (0.14), respectively for easy questions; 1.7 (0.66), 1.8 
      (0.61), 1.7 (0.64) for medium; 2.0 (0.24), 1.8 (0.37), 1.9 (0.27) for hard. GPT-4 
      performed better for all three qualities and difficulty levels than GPT-3.5. The 
      FKG mean for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 answers were 12.8 (1.75) and 10.8 (1.72), 
      respectively; the FRE for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 was 37.3 (9.65) and 47.6 (9.88), 
      respectively. The 2nd prompt has achieved better results in terms of clarity (all 
      pâ&lt;â0.05). CONCLUSIONS: GPT-4 displayed superior accuracy, clarity, conciseness, 
      and readability than GPT-3.5. Though prompts influenced the quality response in 
      both GPTs, their impact was significant only for clarity.

      Generative AI-Based Strategies towards (Portuguese) Sign Language Interpretation.

AB  - Communication between Deaf and hearing individuals remains a persistent challenge 
      requiring attention to foster inclusivity. Despite notable efforts in the 
      development of digital solutions for sign language recognition (SLR), several 
      issues persist, such as cross-platform interoperability and strategies for 
      tokenizing signs to enable continuous conversations and coherent sentence 
      construction. To address such issues, this paper proposes a non-invasive 
      Portuguese Sign Language (LÃ­ngua Gestual Portuguesa or LGP) interpretation 
      system-as-a-service, leveraging skeletal posture sequence inference powered by 
      long-short term memory (LSTM) architectures. To address the scarcity of examples 
      during machine learning (ML) model training, dataset augmentation strategies are 
      explored. Additionally, a buffer-based interaction technique is introduced to 
      facilitate LGP terms tokenization. This technique provides real-time feedback to 
      users, allowing them to gauge the time remaining to complete a sign, which aids 
      in the construction of grammatically coherent sentences based on inferred 
      terms/words. To support human-like conditioning rules for interpretation, a large 
      language model (LLM) service is integrated. Experiments reveal that LSTM-based 
      neural networks, trained with 50 LGP terms and subjected to data augmentation, 
      achieved accuracy levels ranging from 80% to 95.6%. Users unanimously reported a 
      high level of intuition when using the buffer-based interaction strategy for 
      terms/words tokenization. Furthermore, tests with an LLM-specifically 
      ChatGPT-demonstrated promising semantic correlation rates in generated sentences, 
      comparable to expected sentences.

TI  - Almanac - Retrieval-Augmented Language Models for Clinical Medicine.
LID - 10.1056/aioa2300068 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown impressive zero-shot 
      capabilities, whereby they can use auxiliary data, without the availability of 
      task-specific training examples, to complete a variety of natural language tasks, 
      such as summarization, dialogue generation, and question answering. However, 
      despite many promising applications of LLMs in clinical medicine, adoption of 
      these models has been limited by their tendency to generate incorrect and 
      sometimes even harmful statements. METHODS: We tasked a panel of eight 
      board-certified clinicians and two health care practitioners with evaluating 
      Almanac, an LLM framework augmented with retrieval capabilities from curated 
      medical resources for medical guideline and treatment recommendations. The panel 
      compared responses from Almanac and standard LLMs (ChatGPT-4, Bing, and Bard) 
      versus a novel data set of 314 clinical questions spanning nine medical 
      specialties. RESULTS: Almanac showed a significant improvement in performance 
      compared with the standard LLMs across axes of factuality, completeness, user 
      preference, and adversarial safety. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show the potential 
      for LLMs with access to domain-specific corpora to be effective in clinical 
      decision-making. The findings also underscore the importance of carefully testing 
      LLMs before deployment to mitigate their shortcomings. (Funded by the National 
      Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.).

TI  - Large Language Model-Based Chatbot vs Surgeon-Generated Informed Consent 
      Documentation for Common Procedures.
PG  - e2336997
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.36997 [doi]
LID - e2336997
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Informed consent is a critical component of patient care before 
      invasive procedures, yet it is frequently inadequate. Electronic consent forms 
      have the potential to facilitate patient comprehension if they provide 
      information that is readable, accurate, and complete; it is not known if large 
      language model (LLM)-based chatbots may improve informed consent documentation by 
      generating accurate and complete information that is easily understood by 
      patients. OBJECTIVE: To compare the readability, accuracy, and completeness of 
      LLM-based chatbot- vs surgeon-generated information on the risks, benefits, and 
      alternatives (RBAs) of common surgical procedures. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study compared randomly selected 
      surgeon-generated RBAs used in signed electronic consent forms at an academic 
      referral center in San Francisco with LLM-based chatbot-generated (ChatGPT-3.5, 
      OpenAI) RBAs for 6 surgical procedures (colectomy, coronary artery bypass graft, 
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy, inguinal hernia repair, knee arthroplasty, and 
      spinal fusion). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Readability was measured using 
      previously validated scales (Flesh-Kincaid grade level, Gunning Fog index, the 
      Simple Measure of Gobbledygook, and the Coleman-Liau index). Scores range from 0 
      to greater than 20 to indicate the years of education required to understand a 
      text. Accuracy and completeness were assessed using a rubric developed with 
      recommendations from LeapFrog, the Joint Commission, and the American College of 
      Surgeons. Both composite and RBA subgroup scores were compared. RESULTS: The 
      total sample consisted of 36 RBAs, with 1 RBA generated by the LLM-based chatbot 
      and 5 RBAs generated by a surgeon for each of the 6 surgical procedures. The mean 
      (SD) readability score for the LLM-based chatbot RBAs was 12.9 (2.0) vs 15.7 
      (4.0) for surgeon-generated RBAs (Pâ=â.10). The mean (SD) composite completeness 
      and accuracy score was lower for surgeons' RBAs at 1.6 (0.5) than for LLM-based 
      chatbot RBAs at 2.2 (0.4) (Pâ&lt;â.001). The LLM-based chatbot scores were higher 
      than the surgeon-generated scores for descriptions of the benefits of surgery 
      (2.3 [0.7] vs 1.4 [0.7]; Pâ&lt;â.001) and alternatives to surgery (2.7 [0.5] vs 1.4 
      [0.7]; Pâ&lt;â.001). There was no significant difference in chatbot vs surgeon RBA 
      scores for risks of surgery (1.7 [0.5] vs 1.7 [0.4]; Pâ=â.38). CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: The findings of this cross-sectional study suggest that despite not 
      being perfect, LLM-based chatbots have the potential to enhance informed consent 
      documentation. If an LLM were embedded in electronic health records in a manner 
      compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, it could 
      be used to provide personalized risk information while easing documentation 
      burden for physicians.

TI  - The insufficiency of recreational exercises in improving cardiovascular fitness: 
      an investigation of ventricular systolic and diastolic parameters and left atrial 
      mechanical functions.
PG  - 486
LID - 10.1186/s12872-023-03508-0 [doi]
LID - 486
AB  - AIM: This study aimed to compare the left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic 
      parameters and left atrial (LA) mechanical functions of individuals engaging in 
      recreational sports and resistance exercises on a weekly basis. METHODS: A total 
      of 43 male amateur athletes were included in this study, of which 24 performed 
      resistance exercises (REs) (29.70âÂ±â8.74 year, weight: 81.70âÂ±â12.64&nbsp;kg, height: 
      176.05âÂ±â7.73&nbsp;cm, BMI: 27.64âÂ±â4.97&nbsp;kg/m(2)), and 19 participated in recreational 
      football training and were included in the recreational sports group 
      (31.73âÂ±â6.82 year, weight: 86.00âÂ±â18.52&nbsp;kg, height: 178.62âÂ±â4.95&nbsp;cm, BMI: 
      25.55âÂ±â3.42&nbsp;kg/m(2)). The exercises were standardized according to the weekly 
      exercise frequency and volume. After recording the participants' demographic 
      information, the LV systolic and diastolic parameters and LA mechanical functions 
      were measured using echocardiography (ECHO) and Tissue Doppler Imaging. RESULTS: 
      Significant differences were observed in various cardiac parameters between the 
      recreational sports group (REG) and resistance exercise Group (RSG). 
      Specifically, the left ventricular (LV) diastolic diameter, LV end diastolic 
      volume index (LVEDVi), and stroke volume index were notably higher in the REG 
      compared to the RSG (tâ=â2.804, pâ=â.010, effect size (ES)â=â2.10; tâ=â3.174, 
      pâ=â.003, ESâ=â0.98; tâ=â3.36, pâ=â.002, ESâ=â1.02, respectively). Notably, the 
      RSG exhibited higher values for LV mass index (LVMi) and isovolumic relaxation 
      time (IVRT) than the REG (tâ=â2.843, pâ=â.007, ESâ=â0.87; tâ=â2.517, pâ=â.016, 
      ESâ=â0.76) in terms of LV systolic and diastolic parameters. Regarding left 
      atrial (LA) mechanics, the REG demonstrated increased LA total emptying volume 
      index, LA maximum volume index, LA volume before systole measured at the onset of 
      the p-wave index, and conduit volume index compared to RSG (tâ=â2.419, pâ=â.020, 
      ESâ=â0.75; tâ=â2.669, pâ=â.011, ESâ=â0.81; tâ=â2.111, pâ=â.041, ESâ=â0.64; 
      tâ=â2.757, pâ=â.009, ESâ=â0.84, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our study revealed 
      significant variations in LV and LA functions between REG and RSG. Our data 
      suggest that REs led to substantial cardiac remodeling, altering myocardial 
      structure and function. In contrast, the effect of recreational exercise on 
      cardiac adaptation was less pronounced than that of resistance exercise. 
      Consequently, we propose that individuals engaging in recreational exercise 
      should consider modalities that impose higher cardiovascular demand for more 
      effective cardiac conditioning.

AB  - Task conditions significantly impact human motor control. We investigated how 
      task type, difficulty, and constraints influence the kinematics of goal-directed 
      arm reaching. Non-disabled young adults performed two distinct goal-directed arm 
      reaching tasks: pointing and picking up an object with chopsticks. These tasks 
      were carried out under various conditions, including constrained and 
      unconstrained elbow extension and two different task difficulties. We collected 
      kinematic data using a 3-D motion capture system and analyzed the effects of 
      different task conditions on kinematic variables using linear mixed-effects 
      regression analysis. Our findings revealed statistically significant differences 
      in kinematics between the two tasks. Arm reaching during the picking-up task was 
      slower and exhibited jerkier movements compared to the pointing task. 
      Additionally, when arm reaching was performed with constrained elbow extension, 
      it led to slower and jerkier movements, with an increased involvement of trunk 
      movements compared to the unconstrained condition. These findings show that 
      complex manipulative motor tasks requiring higher hand dexterity necessitate 
      feedback-based control of arm reaching, but simple pointing tasks requiring less 
      hand dexterity do not. In conclusion, our study sheds light on the influence of 
      task conditions on goal-directed arm reaching kinematics and provides valuable 
      insights into the motor control strategies involved in different tasks.

AB  - Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), also known as amylin, is a polypeptide hormone 
      co-secreted with insulin by pancreatic Î²-cells. In general, IAPP is soluble and 
      lacks a defined structure. However, under certain conditions, these peptides tend 
      to aggregate into soluble oligomers, eventually forming insoluble amyloid fibrils 
      with typical cross-Î²-sheet structures. Amylin aggregates, therefore, have been 
      regarded as one of the hallmarks of type II diabetes (T2D). Among these 
      aggregated species, oligomers were shown to exhibit significant cytotoxicity, 
      leading to impaired Î²-cell function and reduced Î²-cell mass. Monitoring of 
      oligomer appearance during IAPP fibrillation is of particular interest. In this 
      study, we successfully grafted an aggregation-induced emission molecule, 
      tetraphenylethylene (TPE), at the N-terminus of IAPP. By mixing a small amount of 
      TPE-labeled IAPP with unlabeled IAPP, we were able to detect an increase in TPE 
      fluorescence during the nucleation phase of IAPP aggregation in vitro. It may 
      enable real-time monitoring of IAPP oligomer formation and is further applied in 
      the diagnosis of T2D.

TI  - Benzodiazepine Boom: Tracking Etizolam, Pyrazolam, and Flubromazepam from Pre-UK 
      Psychoactive Act 2016 to Present Using Analytical and Social Listening 
      Techniques.
LID - 10.3390/pharmacy12010013 [doi]
LID - 13
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The designer benzodiazepine (DBZD) market continues to expand 
      whilst evading regulatory controls. The widespread adoption of social media by 
      pro-drug use communities encourages positive discussions around DBZD use/misuse, 
      driving demand. This research addresses the evolution of three popular DBZDs, 
      etizolam (E), flubromazepam (F), and pyrazolam (P), available on the drug market 
      for over a decade, comparing the quantitative chemical analyses of tablet 
      samples, purchased from the internet prior to the implementation of the 
      Psychoactive Substances Act UK 2016, with the thematic netnographic analyses of 
      social media content. METHOD: Drug samples were purchased from the internet in 
      early 2016. The characterisation of all drug batches were performed using 
      UHPLC-MS and supported with (1)H NMR. In addition, netnographic studies across 
      the platforms X (formerly Twitter) and Reddit, between 2016-2023, were conducted. 
      The latter was supported by both manual and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven 
      thematic analyses, using numerous.ai and ChatGPT, of social media threads and 
      discussions. RESULTS: UHPLC-MS confirmed the expected drug in every sample, 
      showing remarkable inter/intra batch variability across all batches (E = 13.8 Â± 
      0.6 to 24.7 Â± 0.9 mg; F = 4.0 Â± 0.2 to 23.5 Â± 0.8 mg; P = 5.2 Â± 0.2 to 11.5 Â± 0.4 
      mg). (1)H NMR could not confirm etizolam as a lone compound in any etizolam 
      batch. Thematic analyses showed etizolam dominated social media discussions (59% 
      of all posts), with 24.2% of posts involving sale/purchase and 17.8% detailing 
      new administration trends/poly-drug use scenarios. Artificial intelligence 
      confirmed three of the top five trends identified manually. CONCLUSIONS: Purity 
      variability identified across all tested samples emphasises the increased 
      potential health risks associated with DBZD consumption. We propose the global 
      DBZD market is exacerbated by surface web social media discussions, recorded 
      across X and Reddit. Despite the appearance of newer analogues, these three DBZDs 
      remain prevalent and popularised. Reporting themes on harm/effects and new 
      developments in poly-drug use trends, demand for DBZDs continues to grow, despite 
      their potent nature and potential risk to life. It is proposed that greater 
      controls and constant live monitoring of social media user content is warranted 
      to drive active regulation strategies and targeted, effective, harm reduction 
      strategies.

TI  - Implementation of Chatbot Technology in Health Care: Protocol for a Bibliometric 
      Analysis.
PG  - e54349
LID - 10.2196/54349 [doi]
LID - e54349
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chatbots have the potential to increase people's access to quality 
      health care. However, the implementation of chatbot technology in the health care 
      system is unclear due to the scarce analysis of publications on the adoption of 
      chatbot in health and medical settings. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents a protocol 
      of a bibliometric analysis aimed at offering the public insights into the current 
      state and emerging trends in research related to the use of chatbot technology 
      for promoting health. METHODS: In this bibliometric analysis, we will select 
      published papers from the databases of CINAHL, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, Scopus, and 
      Web of Science that pertain to chatbot technology and its applications in health 
      care. Our search strategy includes keywords such as "chatbot," "virtual agent," 
      "virtual assistant," "conversational agent," "conversational AI," "interactive 
      agent," "health," and "healthcare." Five researchers who are AI engineers and 
      clinicians will independently review the titles and abstracts of selected papers 
      to determine their eligibility for a full-text review. The corresponding author 
      (ZN) will serve as a mediator to address any discrepancies and disputes among the 
      5 reviewers. Our analysis will encompass various publication patterns of chatbot 
      research, including the number of annual publications, their geographic or 
      institutional distribution, and the number of annual grants supporting chatbot 
      research, and further summarize the methodologies used in the development of 
      health-related chatbots, along with their features and applications in health 
      care settings. Software tool VOSViewer (version 1.6.19; Leiden University) will 
      be used to construct and visualize bibliometric networks. RESULTS: The 
      preparation for the bibliometric analysis began on December 3, 2021, when the 
      research team started the process of familiarizing themselves with the software 
      tools that may be used in this analysis, VOSViewer and CiteSpace, during which 
      they consulted 3 librarians at the Yale University regarding search terms and 
      tentative results. Tentative searches on the aforementioned databases yielded a 
      total of 2340 papers. The official search phase started on July 27, 2023. Our 
      goal is to complete the screening of papers and the analysis by February 15, 
      2024. CONCLUSIONS: Artificial intelligence chatbots, such as ChatGPT (OpenAI 
      Inc), have sparked numerous discussions within the health care industry regarding 
      their impact on human health. Chatbot technology holds substantial promise for 
      advancing health care systems worldwide. However, developing a sophisticated 
      chatbot capable of precise interaction with health care consumers, delivering 
      personalized care, and providing accurate health-related information and 
      knowledge remain considerable challenges. This bibliometric analysis seeks to 
      fill the knowledge gap in the existing literature on health-related chatbots, 
      entailing their applications, the software used in their development, and their 
      preferred functionalities among users. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER

TI  - Is generative pre-trained transformer artificial intelligence (Chat-GPT) a 
      reliable tool for guidelines synthesis? A preliminary evaluation for biologic 
      CRSwNP therapy.
PG  - 2167-2173
LID - 10.1007/s00405-024-08464-9 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Biologic therapies for Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps 
      (CRSwNP) have emerged as an auspicious treatment alternative. However, the ideal 
      patient population, dosage, and treatment duration are yet to be well-defined. 
      Moreover, biologic therapy has disadvantages, such as high costs and limited 
      access. The proposal of a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm offers an 
      intriguing solution for optimizing decision-making protocols. METHODS: The AI 
      algorithm was initially programmed to conduct a systematic literature review 
      searching for the current primary guidelines on biologics' clinical efficacy and 
      safety in treating CRSwNP. The review included a total of 12 studies: 6 
      systematic reviews, 4 expert consensus guidelines, and 2 surveys. Simultaneously, 
      two independent human researchers conducted a literature search to compare the 
      results. Subsequently, the AI was tasked to critically analyze the identified 
      papers, highlighting strengths and weaknesses, thereby creating a decision-making 
      algorithm and pyramid flow chart. RESULTS: The studies evaluated various 
      biologics, including monoclonal antibodies targeting Interleukin-5 (IL-5), IL-4, 
      IL-13, and Immunoglobulin E (IgE), assessing their effectiveness in different 
      patient populations, such as those with comorbid asthma or refractory CRSwNP. 
      Dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the IL-4 receptor alpha subunit, 
      demonstrated significant improvement in nasal symptoms and quality of life in 
      patients with CRSwNP in several randomized controlled trials and systematic 
      reviews. Similarly, mepolizumab and reslizumab, which target IL-5, have also 
      shown efficacy in reducing nasal polyp burden and improving symptoms in patients 
      with CRSwNP, particularly those with comorbid asthma. However, additional studies 
      are required to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of these biologics in 
      treating CRSwNP. CONCLUSIONS: Biologic therapies have surfaced as a promising 
      treatment option for patients with severe or refractory CRSwNP; however, the 
      optimal patient population, dosage, and treatment duration are yet to be defined. 
      The application of AI in decision-making protocols and the creation of 
      therapeutic algorithms for biologic drug selection, could offer fascinating 
      future prospects in the management of CRSwNP.

TI  - Generational Differences in Food Choices and Consumer Behaviors in the Context of 
      Sustainable Development.
LID - 10.3390/foods13040521 [doi]
LID - 521
AB  - (1) Background: This study examines diverse food choices and sustainable 
      consumption behavior across four generations of Poles: Baby Boomers, Generation 
      X, Generation Y, and Generation Z. (2) Methods: The research employed an online 
      survey with a quota sample of 1000 individuals, representing the Polish 
      population in terms of gender, residence, and education (categorized into two 
      groups). (3) Results: For Poles, the crucial factors in food selection were 
      product quality (69.0%), price (68.6%), and information about the product's 
      composition (41.0%). Older cohorts (Baby Boomers and Generation X) prioritized 
      food quality, while younger generations (Generation Y and Generation Z) 
      emphasized price. Statistically significant differences emerged between 
      generations regarding the product's country of origin, with older generations 
      emphasizing its importance more. The oldest group (Baby Boomers) considered 
      ecological certification most important. As much as 85.9% of Poles checked 
      product expiration dates while buying products, and 82.8% bought only as much as 
      they needed. Baby Boomers most often exhibited these two behaviors and can be 
      considered the most responsible among all generations. (4) Conclusions: This 
      article highlights the importance of comprehensive sustainability efforts in the 
      context of food choices. It takes into account the socio-cultural and historical 
      circumstances of each generation that influence their consumer habits.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This scoping review provides an overview of artificial intelligence 
      (AI), including machine and deep learning techniques, in the interpretation of 
      clinical needle electromyography (nEMG) signals. METHODS: A comprehensive search 
      of Medline, Embase and Web of Science was conducted to find peer-reviewed journal 
      articles. All papers published after 2010 were included. The methodological 
      quality of the included studies was assessed with CLAIM (checklist for artificial 
      intelligence in medical imaging). RESULTS: 51 studies were identified that 
      fulfilled the inclusion criteria. 61% used open-source EMGlab data set to develop 
      models to classify nEMG signal in healthy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) 
      and myopathy (25 subjects). Only two articles developed models to classify 
      signals recorded at rest. Most articles reported high performance accuracies, but 
      many were subject to bias and overtraining. CONCLUSIONS: Current AI-models of 
      nEMG signals are not sufficient for clinical implementation. Suggestions for 
      future research include emphasizing the need for an optimal training and 
      validation approach using large datasets of clinical nEMG data from a diverse 
      patient population. SIGNIFICANCE: The outcomes of this study and the suggestions 
      made aim to contribute to developing AI-models that can effectively handle signal 
      quality variability and are suitable for daily clinical practice in interpreting 
      nEMG signals.

AB  - Natural hydraulic lime (NHL)-based binders play a crucial role in preserving 
      cultural heritage structures, ensuring integrity and longevity. Beyond 
      traditional uses, these binders exhibit potential for integration into both 
      non-structural and structural components, being compatible with innovative 
      manufacturing processes such as digital fabrication. Meticulously designed 
      grouts, with applicability in their fresh and hardened states, are essential for 
      heritage stability. This study explores the relationships between mineral 
      additions, chemical admixtures, and lime for grout formulations, aiming to 
      advance our understanding and inform the optimization of materials for heritage 
      restoration. Key questions include the influence of natural volcanic pozzolan 
      (NVP) and metakaolin (MK) on rheology and the impact of varying ratios of 
      superplasticizer on NHL-based grout's rheological behavior. This systematic 
      evaluation of rheological parameters aims to innovate mix designs, expanding 
      NHL-based binders' applicability in construction and science. Our hypotheses 
      suggest that well-designed lime grout formulations, incorporating NVP and MK, can 
      enhance rheological properties, addressing challenges in sustainable construction 
      and heritage conservation. This research provides valuable insights for 
      optimizing lime-based materials, fostering advancements in heritage restoration, 
      and promoting wider NHL-based binder adoption in diverse construction 
      applications.

TI  - Age-Dependent Changes in the Occurrence and Segregation of GABA and Acetylcholine 
      in the Rat Superior Cervical Ganglia.
LID - 10.3390/ijms25052588 [doi]
LID - 2588
AB  - The occurrence, inhibitory modulation, and trophic effects of GABA have been 
      identified in the peripheral sympathetic nervous system. We have demonstrated 
      that GABA and acetylcholine (ACh) may colocalize in the same axonal varicosities 
      or be segregated into separate ones in the rat superior cervical ganglia (SCG). 
      Neurotransmitter segregation varies with age and the presence of neurotrophic 
      factors. Here, we explored age-dependent changes in the occurrence and 
      segregation of GABA and ACh in rats ranging from 2 weeks old (wo) to 12 months 
      old or older. Using immunohistochemistry, we characterized the expression of 
      L-glutamic acid decarboxylase of 67 kDa (GAD67) and vesicular acetylcholine 
      transporter (VAChT) in the rat SCG at 2, 4, 8, 12 wo and 12 months old or older. 
      Our findings revealed that GAD67 was greater at 2 wo compared with the other 
      ages, whereas VAChT levels were greater at 4 wo than at 12 wo and 12 months old 
      or older. The segregation of these neurotransmitters was more pronounced at 2 and 
      4 wo. We observed a caudo-rostral gradient of segregation degree at 8 and 12 wo. 
      Data point out that the occurrence and segregation of GABA and ACh exhibit 
      developmental adaptative changes throughout the lifetime of rats. We hypothesize 
      that during the early postnatal period, the increase in GABA and GABA-ACh 
      segregation promotes the release of GABA alone which might play a role in trophic 
      actions.

AB  - The present study probes into the complexities of wound management in obesity by 
      proposing a novel biomaterial designed to reprogram the altered skin physiology 
      prevalent in obese conditions. The strategy involves the development of a 
      multifunctional biomaterial addressing issues such as excessive exudate, pressure 
      ulcers, and reduced vascularity. The bio-matrix demonstrates the localized 
      transformation of white adipocytes through trans-browning, coupled with the 
      simultaneous induction of angiogenesis at obese wound sites, resulting in 
      expedited wound closure. The collagen bio-matrices, stabilized with Resveratrol 
      (Rsv), exhibit remarkable thermal, mechanical, and biological stability. The 
      porous 3D microstructure of the Rsv-stabilized collagen bio-matrix closely 
      resembled the natural extracellular matrix, facilitating effective cell adhesion. 
      The bio-matrix exhibited the unique capability to induce localized thermogenesis 
      in the subcutaneous fat layer while concurrently activating angiogenesis. In vivo 
      wound healing studies conducted on DIO-C57BL6 mice demonstrated complete healing 
      within 10&nbsp;days, showcasing accelerated tissue regeneration, blood vessel 
      formation, robust collagen deposition, and significant activation of browning in 
      the subcutaneous adipose layer. This study introduces the concept of tailored 
      regenerative biomaterials with the ability to reprogram the challenging wound 
      environment associated with obesity. This innovative approach opens up new 
      avenues for enhanced wound care strategies, particularly for bariatric patients.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in electrocardiography (ECG) to 
      assist in diagnosis, stratification, and management. AI algorithms can help 
      clinicians in the following areas: (1) interpretation and detection of 
      arrhythmias, ST-segment changes, QT prolongation, and other ECG abnormalities; 
      (2) risk prediction integrated with or without clinical variables (to predict 
      arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death, stroke, and other cardiovascular events); (3) 
      monitoring ECG signals from cardiac implantable electronic devices and wearable 
      devices in real time and alerting clinicians or patients when significant changes 
      occur according to timing, duration, and situation; (4) signal processing, 
      improving ECG quality and accuracy by removing noise/artifacts/interference, and 
      extracting features not visible to the human eye (heart rate variability, 
      beat-to-beat intervals, wavelet transforms, sample-level resolution, etc.); (5) 
      therapy guidance, assisting in patient selection, optimizing treatments, 
      improving symptom-to-treatment times, and cost effectiveness (earlier activation 
      of code infarction in patients with ST-segment elevation, predicting the response 
      to antiarrhythmic drugs or cardiac implantable devices therapies, reducing the 
      risk of cardiac toxicity, etc.); (6) facilitating the integration of ECG data 
      with other modalities (imaging, genomics, proteomics, biomarkers, etc.). In the 
      future, AI is expected to play an increasingly important role in ECG diagnosis 
      and management, as more data become available and more sophisticated algorithms 
      are developed.

AB  - Boron compounds play a crucial role in various industries, and accurate 
      quantification of boron is essential for quality control and environmental 
      monitoring. This study presents a simple, rapid, and reliable method for 
      determining boron in aqueous solutions using suppressed ion chromatography 
      coupled to electrospray ionisation-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry 
      (IC-ESI-QqQ-MS). Boric acid (B(OH)(3)) was retained as the tetrahydroxyborate ion 
      (B(OH)(4)(-)) on a CarboPac PA300-4&nbsp;Î¼m anion-exchange column using isocratic 
      elution with 40&nbsp;mM KOH. During the neutralization process at the suppressor, 
      B(OH)(4)(-) was converted to B(OH)(3), which subsequently generated the 
      metaborate ion [BO(2)](-) (m/z 43) within the electrospray ionisation source. By 
      employing a pseudo-selected reaction monitoring (SRM) transition from m/z 43 to 
      m/z 43, the method achieved a limit of detection (LOD) of 2.45&nbsp;Î¼g/L of boron, the 
      lowest reported in the literature to-date for an IC-based method. The analytical 
      performance of the method demonstrated no carry-over issues, no matrix 
      interferences, and excellent intra- and inter-run repeatability of 2.03% and 
      3.41%, respectively. The method was applied to the evaluation of boron uptake and 
      retention by Tasmanian Oak timber blocks, treated by dip-diffusion in a boric

AB  - Most hematological malignancies display heightened glycolytic activity, leading 
      to their detectability through (18)F-FDG-PET imaging. PET quantification enables 
      the extraction of metabolic information from tumors. Among various PET 
      measurements, maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), which indicates the 
      highest value of (18)F-FDG uptake within the tumor, has emerged as the commonly 
      used parameter in clinical oncology. This is because of SUVmax ease of 
      calculation using most available commercial workstations, as well as its 
      simplicity and independence from observer interpretation. Nonetheless, SUVmax 
      represents the increase in activity within a specific small area, which may not 
      fully capture the overall tumor uptake. Volumetric PET parameters have been 
      identified as a potential solution to overcome certain limitations associated 
      with SUVmax. However, these parameters are influenced by the low spatial 
      resolution of PET when assessing small lesions. Another challenge is the high 
      number of lesions observed in some patients, leading to a time-consuming process 
      for evaluating all focal lesions. Some institutions recently have started 
      advocating for CT-based segmentation as a method for measuring radiotracer uptake 
      in the bone marrow and overall bone of the patients. This review article aims to 
      provide insights into clinical application of PET quantification specifically 
      focusing on 3 major hematologic malignancies: multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and 
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

TI  - Amputation surgery associated with shortened survival in patients with localized 
      extremity bone sarcoma.
PG  - 124-130
LID - 10.1016/j.jor.2024.03.017 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study assesses survival rates among patients with localized 
      extremity bone sarcoma who have undergone amputation, pinpointing subpopulations 
      that are disproportionately affected by amputation-related survival disparities. 
      METHODS: Examination of data was conducted using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, 
      and End Results (SEER) program, analyzing records of 3765 patients diagnosed with 
      localized extremity bone sarcoma between 2000 and 2019. Of these, 857 received 
      amputations (Amputation cohort), and 2908 underwent limb-sparing surgeries. 
      Propensity score matching, considering demographic and clinical features, was 
      utilized to ensure a fair comparison. RESULTS: Following propensity score 
      matching, the study focused on 1714 cases. The Amputation cohort was observed to 
      have significantly poorer survival rates (Cancer-Specific Survival [CSS]: Hazard 
      Ratio [HR]&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.28, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.05-1.55; Overall Survival 
      [OS]: HR&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.37, 95% CI: 1.15-1.63). Subsequent subgroup analysis indicated that 
      individuals with tumors exceeding 8&nbsp;cm in size or those located in the lower 
      limbs were notably at a higher risk of shortened survival (for tumors &gt;8&nbsp;cm - 
      CSS: HR&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.32, 95% CI: 1.02-1.71; OS: HR&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.39, 95% CI: 1.09-1.76; for lower 
      limb tumors - CSS: HR&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.25, 95% CI: 1.01-1.54; OS: HR&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.33, 95% CI: 
      1.11-1.61). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that patients diagnosed with 
      localized extremity bone sarcoma undergoing amputation exhibit lower survival 
      rates, especially in cases involving tumors of greater size or those situated in 
      the lower limbs. In patient groups where amputation is inevitable, careful 
      follow-up is required after surgical intervention.

AB  - Despite numerous available agents claiming anti-biofilm properties on wounds, the 
      substantiating evidence remains inconclusive. This study aimed to assess the 
      immediate impact of topical wound treatments on wound biofilm and healing 
      outcomes in acute and chronic ulcers. We comprehensively searched PubMed, 
      ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google Scholar. In addition, eligible gray literature was 
      incorporated. English-language randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 
      observational, cohort, and case-control studies targeting biofilm prevention, 
      inhibition, or elimination across diverse wound types were included. Primary 
      outcomes included biofilm presence and elimination, supplemented by secondary 
      outcomes encompassing reduced wound size, complete closure, and diminished 
      infection indicators. Bacterial load reduction and biofilm presence were also 
      assessed. Twenty-eight articles met the inclusion criteria. Various modalities 
      were identified, including biofilm-visualization techniques, such as wound 
      blotting and handheld autofluorescence imaging. Pooled analysis for the primary 
      outcomes was infeasible due to limited eligible studies and data-reporting 
      challenges. As for the secondary outcomes, the pooled analysis for complete 
      surgical wound closure (2 RCTs, yielding n=284) and presence of surgical site 
      infections/inflammation (2 RCTs, yielding n=284) showed no significant 
      difference, with a log odds ratio (LOD) of 0.58 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 
      -.33, 1.50) and LOD -0.95 (95% CI: -3.54, 1.64; Ï(2) = 2.32, Q = 2.71, P = .10), 
      respectively. Our findings suggest insufficient evidence to support anti-biofilm 
      claims of topical modalities. Clinicians' skill appears to play a pivotal role in 
      biofilm elimination and wound healing enhancement, with potential optimization 
      through visual-guided techniques, such as wound blotting and autofluorescence 
      imaging. More rigorous clinical trials are warranted to ascertain the efficacy of 
      these techniques.Level of Evidence: Therapeutic, 1A.

TI  - Effectiveness of health checkup with depression screening on depression treatment 
      and outcomes in middle-aged and older adults: a target trial emulation study.

LID - 100978
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adult preventive health checkups with depression screening were 
      launched in August 2011 in Taiwan; however, its impact has not yet been 
      evaluated. This study aimed to use real-world data to assess the effectiveness of 
      depression screening among middle-aged and older adults. METHODS: A total of 
      4,972,228 adults aged 40 years and above who participated in a health checkup 
      with depression screening between 2013 and 2019 and the same number of unscreened 
      counterparts were included. The target trial emulation study was conducted to 
      estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) for newly treated depression, psychiatric 
      hospitalisation, and suicide. The changes in HRs during the study period were 
      assessed using interval Cox models. FINDINGS: The screening group had a higher 
      rate of newly treated depression (HR 1.63 [95% CI 1.62, 1.64]) and a lower risk 
      of psychiatric hospitalisation (HR 0.93 [95% CI 0.91, 0.95]). There was a null 
      association between depression screening and suicide; however, a higher suicide 
      risk was found in screened older adults aged 65 years and above. Only 10.8% 
      received depression treatment during the study period among the screen-positive 
      individuals. INTERPRETATION: Health checkups with depression screening could 
      potentially promote depression treatment and reduce the risk of psychiatric 
      hospitalisation; however, there was no effect on suicide. The treatment rate for 
      depression remained low after screening for depression. Further attention to 
      enhance referral and treatment is required. FUNDING: The study was funded by the 
      National Health Research Institutes, Taiwan.

AB  - Screening potential drug-drug interactions, drug-gene interactions, 
      contraindications, and other factors is crucial in clinical practice. However, 
      implementing these screening concepts in real-world settings poses challenges. 
      This work proposes an approach towards precision medicine that combines genetic 
      and nongenetic factors to facilitate clinical decision-making. The approach 
      focuses on raising the performance of four potential interaction screenings in 
      the prescribing process, including drug-drug interactions, drug-gene 
      interactions, drug-herb interactions, drug-social lifestyle interactions, and two 
      potential considerations for patients with liver or renal impairment. The work 
      describes the design of a curated knowledge-based model called the knowledge 
      model for potential interaction and consideration screening, the screening logic 
      for both the detection module and inference module, and the personalized 
      prescribing report. Three case studies have demonstrated the proof-of-concept and 
      effectiveness of this approach. The proposed approach aims to reduce 
      decision-making processes for healthcare professionals, reduce medication-related 
      harm, and enhance treatment effectiveness. Additionally, the recommendation with 
      a semantic network is suggested to assist in risk-benefit analysis when health 
      professionals plan therapeutic interventions with new medicines that have 
      insufficient evidence to establish explicit recommendations. This approach offers 
      a promising solution to implementing precision medicine in clinical practice.

TI  - Hyperglycemia and Oxidative Stress: An Integral, Updated and Critical Overview of 
      Their Metabolic Interconnections.
LID - 10.3390/ijms24119352 [doi]
LID - 9352
AB  - This review focuses on the multiple and reciprocal relationships that exist 
      between oxidative stress, hyperglycemia and diabetes and related metabolic 
      disorders. Human metabolism uses most of the consumed glucose under aerobic 
      conditions. Oxygen is needed in the mitochondria to obtain energy, as well as for 
      the action of microsomal oxidases and cytosolic pro-oxidant enzymes. This 
      relentlessly generates a certain amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS). 
      Although ROS are intracellular signals necessary for some physiological 
      processes, their accumulation leads to oxidative stress, hyperglycemia, and 
      progressive resistance to insulin. A cellular pro-oxidant versus an antioxidant 
      equilibrium would regulate ROS levels, but oxidative stress, hyperglycemia, and 
      pro-inflammatory conditions feed back to each other and the relevance of the 
      interconnections tends to increase those conditions. Hyperglycemia promotes 
      collateral glucose metabolism through protein kinase C, polyols and hexosamine 
      routes. In addition, it also facilitates spontaneous glucose auto-oxidation and 
      the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which in turn interact 
      with their receptors (RAGE). The mentioned processes undermine cellular 
      structures, finally giving place to a progressively greater degree of oxidative 
      stress with further hyperglycemia, metabolic alterations, and diabetes 
      complications. NFÎºB is the major transcription factor involved in the expression 
      of most of the pro-oxidant mediators, while Nrf2 is the major transcription 
      factor regulating the antioxidant response. FoxO is also involved in the 
      equilibrium, but its role is controversial. This review summarizes the key 
      factors linking the diverse glucose metabolic routes enhanced in hyperglycemia 
      with ROS formation and vice versa, emphasizing the role of the major 
      transcription factors involved in the desirable balance between pro-oxidant and 
      antioxidant proteins.

TI  - Ultrasound-detected effusion-synovitis is associated with greater limb loading 
      rate asymmetry during walking post-ACL reconstruction: A pilot study.
LID - 100175 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ostima.2024.100175 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Chronic inflammation and altered walking biomechanics are common after 
      ACL reconstruction (ACLR) and contribute to the development of osteoarthritis. 
      Clinically accessible techniques are needed to monitor inflammation 
      (ultrasound-assessed effusion-synovitis) and walking biomechanics 
      (force-measuring insoles), and they must improve the translation of these 
      assessments and determine whether inflammation and walking biomechanics are 
      related in patients after ACLR. This study aimed to determine the association 
      between ultrasound-detected knee effusion-synovitis and limb loading asymmetries 
      during walking in patients 1-5 years post-ACLR. DESIGN: 15 participants (9 women; 
      age: 26 Â± 6yrs; mass: 71 Â± 15 kg; height: 173 Â± 9 cm; months post-ACLR: 29 Â± 13) 
      were included in this cross-sectional study. Knee effusion-synovitis was assessed 
      using a standardized protocol and graded using a validated scoring atlas (0 = 
      absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) in the ACLR limb. Force-measuring 
      insoles were used to capture the vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) during a 
      one-minute treadmill walking trial. Limb symmetry indices (LSIs) were used to 
      quantify limb loading asymmetry for the peak vGRF and the instantaneous loading 
      rate (vGRF-LR). Spearman correlations determined whether effusion-synovitis grade 
      was associated with peak vGRF and vGRF-LR LSI. RESULTS: Effusion-synovitis was 
      present in the ACLR limb of 13/15 (87 %) participants (Grade 0: n = 2; Grade 1: n 
      = 8; Grade 2: n = 4, Grade 3: n = 1). Effusion-synovitis grade was not 
      significantly associated with peak vGRF LSI (meanÂ±sd: 98.0 Â± 5.6; Ï = 0.38, p = 
      0.162), but was significantly associated with vGRF-LR LSI (98.2 Â± 11.4; Ï = 0.55, 
      p = 0.035). CONCLUSION: Most participants 1-5 years post-ACLR have 
      ultrasound-detected effusion-synovitis. Participants with more severe 
      effusion-synovitis load their ACLR limb more rapidly. This study highlights the 
      utility of clinically accessible techniques in assessing inflammation and walking 
      biomechanics in ACLR patients.

TI  - IVIM-Morph: Motion-compensated quantitative Intra-voxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) 
      analysis for functional fetal lung maturity assessment from diffusion-weighted 
      MRI data.
LID - arXiv:2401.07126v2
AB  - Quantitative analysis of pseudo-diffusion in diffusion-weighted magnetic 
      resonance imaging (DWI) data shows potential for assessing fetal lung maturation 
      and generating valuable imaging biomarkers. Yet, the clinical utility of DWI data 
      is hindered by unavoidable fetal motion during acquisition. We present 
      IVIM-morph, a self-supervised deep neural network model for motion-corrected 
      quantitative analysis of DWI data using the Intra-voxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) 
      model. IVIM-morph combines two sub-networks, a registration sub-network, and an 
      IVIM model fitting sub-network, enabling simultaneous estimation of IVIM model 
      parameters and motion. To promote physically plausible image registration, we 
      introduce a biophysically informed loss function that effectively balances 
      registration and model-fitting quality. We validated the efficacy of IVIM-morph 
      by establishing a correlation between the predicted IVIM model parameters of the 
      lung and gestational age (GA) using fetal DWI data of 39 subjects. Our approach 
      was compared against six baseline methods: 1) no motion compensation, 2) affine 
      registration of all DWI images to the initial image, 3) deformable registration 
      of all DWI images to the initial image, 4) deformable registration of each DWI 
      image to its preceding image in the sequence, 5) iterative deformable motion 
      compensation combined with IVIM model parameter estimation, and 6) 
      self-supervised deep-learning-based deformable registration. IVIM-morph exhibited 
      a notably improved correlation with gestational age (GA) when performing in-vivo 
      quantitative analysis of fetal lung DWI data during the canalicular phase. 
      Specifically, over 2 test groups of cases, it achieved an Rf2 of 0.44 and 0.52, 
      outperforming the values of 0.27 and 0.25, 0.25 and 0.00, 0.00 and 0.00, 0.38 and 
      0.00, and 0.07 and 0.14 obtained by other methods. IVIM-morph shows potential in 
      developing valuable biomarkers for non-invasive assessment of fetal lung maturity 
      with DWI data. Moreover, its adaptability opens the door to potential 
      applications in other clinical contexts where motion compensation is essential 
      for quantitative DWI analysis. The IVIM-morph code is readily available 
      at:https://github.com/TechnionComputationalMRILab/qDWI-Morph.

AB  - In this study, we applied AcmB2, sourced from Sterolibacterium denitrificans, to 
      catalyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of 3-ketolupeol (lupenone), a derivative 
      of lupeol, triterpene obtained from birch bark. This enzymatic 
      Î(1)-dehydrogenation catalyzed by AcmB2 yielded glochidone, a bioactive compound 
      frequently obtained from medicinal plants like Salvia trichoclada and Maytenus 
      boria. Glochidone is known for its broad biological activities, including 
      antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antidiabetic as well as 
      acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Our research demonstrates &gt;99% conversion 
      efficiency with 100% regioselectivity of the reaction. The effective conversion 
      to glochidone employed an electron acceptor e.g., potassium hexacyanoferrate III, 
      in mild, environmentally friendly conditions: 8-16% 
      2-hydroxypropyl-Î²-cyclodextrin, and 2-3% 2-methoxyethanol. AcmB2 reaction optimum 
      was determined at pH 8.0 and 30(o)C. Enzyme's biochemical attributes such as 
      electron acceptor type, concentration and steroid substrate specificity were 
      investigated. Among 4-, 5- and 6-ring steroid derivatives androst-4-en-3,17-dione 
      and testosterone propionate were determined as the best substrates of AcmB2. 
      Î(1)-Dehydrogenation of substrates such as lupenone, diosgenone and 
      3-ketopetromyzonol was confirmed. We have assessed the antioxidant and 
      rejuvenating characteristics of glochidone as an active component in 
      formulations, considering its precursors, lupeol, and lupenone as well. 
      Glochidone exhibited limited antioxidant and chelating capabilities compared to 
      lupeol and reference compounds. However, it demonstrated robust rejuvenating 
      properties, with a sirtuin induction level of 61.5 Â± 1.87%, notably surpassing 
      that of the reference substance, E-resveratrol (45.15 Â± 0.09%). Additionally, 
      glochidone displayed 26.5Â±0.67 and 19.41Â±0.76% inhibition of elastase and 
      collagenase, respectively. The safety of all studied triterpenes was confirmed on 
      skin reconstructed human Epidermis model. These findings provide valuable 
      insights into the potential applications of glochidone in formulations aimed at 
      addressing skin health concerns. This research presents the first example of an 
      enzyme in the 3-ketosteroid dehydrogenase (KstD) family catalyzing the 
      Î(1)-dehydrogenation of a pentacyclic triterpene. We also explored structural 
      differences between AcmB, AcmB2, and related KstDs pointing to G52 and P532 as 
      potentially responsible for the unique substrate specificity of AcmB2. Our 
      findings not only highlight the enzyme's capabilities but also present novel 
      enzymatic pathways for bioactive compound synthesis.

TI  - The Monarch Initiative in 2024: an analytic platform integrating phenotypes, 
      genes&nbsp;and diseases across species.

AB  - Bridging the gap between genetic variations, environmental determinants, and 
      phenotypic outcomes is critical for supporting clinical diagnosis and 
      understanding mechanisms of diseases. It requires integrating open data at a 
      global scale. The Monarch Initiative advances these goals by developing open 
      ontologies, semantic data models, and knowledge graphs for translational 
      research. The Monarch App is an integrated platform combining data about genes, 
      phenotypes, and diseases across species. Monarch's APIs enable access to 
      carefully curated datasets and advanced analysis tools that support the 
      understanding and diagnosis of disease for diverse applications such as variant 
      prioritization, deep phenotyping, and patient profile-matching. We have migrated 
      our system into a scalable, cloud-based infrastructure; simplified Monarch's data 
      ingestion and knowledge graph integration systems; enhanced data mapping and 
      integration standards; and developed a new user interface with novel search and 
      graph navigation features. Furthermore, we advanced Monarch's analytic tools by 
      developing a customized plugin for OpenAI's ChatGPT to increase the reliability 
      of its responses about phenotypic data, allowing us to interrogate the knowledge 
      in the Monarch graph using state-of-the-art Large Language Models. The resources 
      of the Monarch Initiative can be found at monarchinitiative.org and its 
      corresponding code repository at github.com/monarch-initiative/monarch-app.

TI  - An approach for collaborative development of a federated biomedical knowledge 
      graph-based question-answering system: Question-of-the-Month challenges.

AB  - Knowledge graphs have become a common approach for knowledge representation. Yet, 
      the application of graph methodology is elusive due to the sheer number and 
      complexity of knowledge sources. In addition, semantic incompatibilities hinder 
      efforts to harmonize and integrate across these diverse sources. As part of The 
      Biomedical Translator Consortium, we have developed a knowledge graph-based 
      question-answering system designed to augment human reasoning and accelerate 
      translational scientific discovery: the Translator system. We have applied the 
      Translator system to answer biomedical questions in the context of a broad array 
      of diseases and syndromes, including Fanconi anemia, primary ciliary dyskinesia, 
      multiple sclerosis, and others. A variety of collaborative approaches have been 
      used to research and develop the Translator system. One recent approach involved 
      the establishment of a monthly "Question-of-the-Month (QotM) Challenge" series. 
      Herein, we describe the structure of the QotM Challenge; the six challenges that 
      have been conducted to date on drug-induced liver injury, cannabidiol toxicity, 
      coronavirus infection, diabetes, psoriatic arthritis, and ATP1A3-related 
      phenotypes; the scientific insights that have been gleaned during the challenges; 
      and the technical issues that were identified over the course of the challenges 
      and that can now be addressed to foster further development of the prototype 
      Translator system. We close with a discussion on Large Language Models such as 
      ChatGPT and highlight differences between those models and the Translator system.

TI  - Accuracy and Reliability of Chatbot Responses to Physician Questions.
PG  - e2336483
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.36483 [doi]
LID - e2336483
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Natural language processing tools, such as ChatGPT (generative 
      pretrained transformer, hereafter referred to as chatbot), have the potential to 
      radically enhance the accessibility of medical information for health 
      professionals and patients. Assessing the safety and efficacy of these tools in 
      answering physician-generated questions is critical to determining their 
      suitability in clinical settings, facilitating complex decision-making, and 
      optimizing health care efficiency. OBJECTIVE: To assess the accuracy and 
      comprehensiveness of chatbot-generated responses to physician-developed medical 
      queries, highlighting the reliability and limitations of artificial 
      intelligence-generated medical information. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: 
      Thirty-three physicians across 17 specialties generated 284 medical questions 
      that they subjectively classified as easy, medium, or hard with either binary 
      (yes or no) or descriptive answers. The physicians then graded the 
      chatbot-generated answers to these questions for accuracy (6-point Likert scale 
      with 1 being completely incorrect and 6 being completely correct) and 
      completeness (3-point Likert scale, with 1 being incomplete and 3 being complete 
      plus additional context). Scores were summarized with descriptive statistics and 
      compared using the Mann-Whitney U test or the Kruskal-Wallis test. The study 
      (including data analysis) was conducted from January to May 2023. MAIN OUTCOMES 
      AND MEASURES: Accuracy, completeness, and consistency over time and between 2 
      different versions (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) of chatbot-generated medical responses. 
      RESULTS: Across all questions (nâ=â284) generated by 33 physicians (31 faculty 
      members and 2 recent graduates from residency or fellowship programs) across 17 
      specialties, the median accuracy score was 5.5 (IQR, 4.0-6.0) (between almost 
      completely and complete correct) with a mean (SD) score of 4.8 (1.6) (between 
      mostly and almost completely correct). The median completeness score was 3.0 
      (IQR, 2.0-3.0) (complete and comprehensive) with a mean (SD) score of 2.5 (0.7). 
      For questions rated easy, medium, and hard, the median accuracy scores were 6.0 
      (IQR, 5.0-6.0), 5.5 (IQR, 5.0-6.0), and 5.0 (IQR, 4.0-6.0), respectively (mean 
      [SD] scores were 5.0 [1.5], 4.7 [1.7], and 4.6 [1.6], respectively; Pâ=â.05). 
      Accuracy scores for binary and descriptive questions were similar (median score, 
      6.0 [IQR, 4.0-6.0] vs 5.0 [IQR, 3.4-6.0]; mean [SD] score, 4.9 [1.6] vs 4.7 
      [1.6]; Pâ=â.07). Of 36 questions with scores of 1.0 to 2.0, 34 were requeried or 
      regraded 8 to 17 days later with substantial improvement (median score 2.0 [IQR, 
      1.0-3.0] vs 4.0 [IQR, 2.0-5.3]; Pâ&lt;â.01). A subset of questions, regardless of 
      initial scores (version 3.5), were regenerated and rescored using version 4 with 
      improvement (mean accuracy [SD] score, 5.2 [1.5] vs 5.7 [0.8]; median score, 6.0 
      [IQR, 5.0-6.0] for original and 6.0 [IQR, 6.0-6.0] for rescored; Pâ=â.002). 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, chatbot generated 
      largely accurate information to diverse medical queries as judged by academic 
      physician specialists with improvement over time, although it had important 
      limitations. Further research and model development are needed to correct 
      inaccuracies and for validation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a health empowerment 
      programme (HEP) to enhance cardiovascular health for adults from low-income 
      families. METHODS: A prospective cohort study (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;219, Intervention group: 
      n&nbsp;=&nbsp;103, comparison group: n&nbsp;=&nbsp;116) was conducted with participants recruited 
      from January 2013 to November 2015 and followed up until January 2022. Throughout 
      the study duration, intervention group were invited to participate in the HEP. 
      The cardiovascular health status of both groups at baseline and follow-up were 
      assessed using the adapted Ideal Cardiovascular Health Index (ICHI) defined by 
      the American Heart Association. After inverse propensity score weighting, 
      multiple linear regression and Poisson regression were employed to examine the 
      effects of the HEP. RESULTS: The HEP was associated with a greater increase in 
      ICHI total score (B = 0.33, p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.001), and the increase of proportion of people 
      achieving a normal blood pressure (Incidence rate ratio: 3.39, p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05). 
      CONCLUSION: HEP can be an effective and sustainable strategy to reduce social 
      disparities in cardiovascular health of adults from low-income families, as 
      indicated by improvement in the ICHI total score and blood pressure status. 
      PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The sustainable HEP in the community setting has 
      potential for generalizability and scalability to other financially challenged 
      families.

AB  - Background: In attempts to elucidate PTSD, recent factor analytic studies 
      resulted in complex models with a proliferating number of factors that lack 
      psychometrical and clinical utility. Recently, suggestions have been made to 
      optimize factor analytic practices to meet a refined set of statistical and 
      psychometric criteria.Objective: This study aims to assess the factorial 
      structure of the German version of the PCL-5, implementing recent methodological 
      advancements to address the risk of overfitting models. In doing so we diverge 
      from traditional factor analytical research on PTSD.Method: On a large-scale 
      sample of the German general population (nâ=â1625), exploratory factor analyses 
      were run to investigate the dimensionality found within the data. Subsequently, 
      we validated and compared all model suggestions from our preliminary analyses 
      plus all standard and common alternative PTSD factor models (including the ICD-11 
      model) from previous literature with confirmatory factor analyses. We not only 
      consider model fit indices based on WLSMV estimation but also deploy criteria 
      such as favouring less complex models with a parsimonious number of factors, 
      sufficient items per factor, low inter-factor correlations and number of model 
      misspecifications.Results: All tested models showed adequate to excellent fit in 
      respect to traditional model fit indices; however, models with two or more 
      factors increasingly failed to meet other statistical and psychometric 
      criteria.Conclusion: Based on the results we favour a two-factor bifactor model 
      with a strong general PTSD factor and two less dominant specific factors - one 
      factor with trauma-related symptoms (re-experiencing and avoidance) and one 
      factor with global psychological symptoms (describing the trauma's higher-order 
      impact on mood, cognition, behaviour and arousal).From the perspective of 
      clinical utility, we recommend the cut-off scoring method for the German version 
      of the PCL-5. Basic psychometric properties and scale characteristics are 
      provided.

OAB - We contribute new insights to the debate on the factor structure of the PTSD 
      Checklist (PCL-5) based on a large German general population sample deploying the 
      newest methodological developments in a revised factor-analytical 
      approach.Combining theoretical, statistical and practical considerations, we 
      favour a two-factor bifactor model with a strong general PTSD factor and two less 
      dominant specific factors â one factor with trauma-related symptoms and one 
      factor with global psychological symptoms.For clinical practitioners, we 
      recommend using the cut-off scoring method.

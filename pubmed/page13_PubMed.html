TI  - Setting research priorities for global pandemic preparedness: An international 
      consensus and comparison with ChatGPT's output.
PG  - 04054
LID - 10.7189/jogh.14.04054 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: In this priority-setting exercise, we sought to identify leading 
      research priorities needed for strengthening future pandemic preparedness and 
      response across countries. METHODS: The International Society of Global Health 
      (ISoGH) used the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHNRI) method to 
      identify research priorities for future pandemic preparedness. Eighty experts in 
      global health, translational and clinical research identified 163 research ideas, 
      of which 42 experts then scored based on five pre-defined criteria. We calculated 
      intermediate criterion-specific scores and overall research priority scores from 
      the mean of individual scores for each research idea. We used a bootstrap 
      (n = 1000) to compute the 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Key priorities 
      included strengthening health systems, rapid vaccine and treatment production, 
      improving international cooperation, and enhancing surveillance efficiency. Other 
      priorities included learning from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
      pandemic, managing supply chains, identifying planning gaps, and promoting 
      equitable interventions. We compared this CHNRI-based outcome with the 14 
      research priorities generated and ranked by ChatGPT, encountering both striking 
      similarities and clear differences. CONCLUSIONS: Priority setting processes based 
      on human crowdsourcing - such as the CHNRI method - and the output provided by 
      ChatGPT are both valuable, as they complement and strengthen each other. The 
      priorities identified by ChatGPT were more grounded in theory, while those 
      identified by CHNRI were guided by recent practical experiences. Addressing these 
      priorities, along with improvements in health planning, equitable community-based 
      interventions, and the capacity of primary health care, is vital for better 
      pandemic preparedness and response in many settings.

TI  - Computational screening of biomarkers and potential drugs for arthrofibrosis 
      based on combination of sequencing and large nature language model.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Arthrofibrosis (AF) is a fibrotic joint disease resulting from 
      excessive collagen production and fibrous scar formation after total knee 
      arthroplasty (TKA). This devastating complication may cause consistent pain and 
      dramatically reduction of functionality. Unfortunately, the conservative 
      treatments to prevent the AF in the early stage are largely unknown due to the 
      lack of specific biomarkers and reliable therapeutic targets. METHODS: In this 
      study, we extracted1782 fibrosis related genes (FRGs) from 373,461published 
      literature based on the large natural language processing models (ChatGPT) and 
      intersected with the 2750 differential expressed genes (DEGs) from mRNA 
      microarray (GSE135854). A total of 311 potential AF biomarker genes (PABGs) were 
      obtained and functional analysis were performed including gene ontology (GO) 
      annotation and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway 
      enrichment analyses. Subsequently, we accomplished validation in AF animal models 
      with immobilization of the unilateral knee joints of 16 rabbits for 1-week, 
      2-weeks, 3-weeks and 4-weeks. Finally, we tested the biomarkers in a 
      retrospective cohort enrolled 35 AF patients and 35 control group patients. 
      RESULTS: We identified G-protein-coupled receptor 17 (GPR17) as a reliable 
      therapeutic biomarker for AF diagnosis with higher AUC (0.819) in the ROC curve. 
      A total of 21 potential drugs targeted to GPR17 were screened. Among them, 
      pranlukast and montelukast have achieved therapeutic effect in animal models. In 
      addition, we established an online AF database for data integration 
      (https://chenxi2023.shinyapps.io/afdbv1). CONCLUSIONS: These results unveiling 
      therapeutic biomarkers for AF diagnosis, and provide potential drugs for clinical 
      treatment. THE TRANSLATIONAL POTENTIAL OF THIS ARTICLE: Our study demonstrated 
      that GPR17 holds significant promise as a potential biomarker and therapeutic 
      target for arthrofibrosis. Moreover, pranlukast and montelukast targeted to GPR17 
      that could be instrumental in the treatment of AF.

AB  - Large language models (LLMs) can respond to free-text queries without being 
      specifically trained in the task in question, causing excitement and concern 
      about their use in healthcare settings. ChatGPT is a generative artificial 
      intelligence (AI) chatbot produced through sophisticated fine-tuning of an LLM, 
      and other tools are emerging through similar developmental processes. Here we 
      outline how LLM applications such as ChatGPT are developed, and we discuss how 
      they are being leveraged in clinical settings. We consider the strengths and 
      limitations of LLMs and their potential to improve the efficiency and 
      effectiveness of clinical, educational and research work in medicine. LLM 
      chatbots have already been deployed in a range of biomedical contexts, with 
      impressive but mixed results. This review acts as a primer for interested 
      clinicians, who will determine if and how LLM technology is used in healthcare 
      for the benefit of patients and practitioners.

TI  - Closed Negative Suction Drain Entrapment in Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Report on 
      the Implications of a Broken Drain Based on the ChatGPT Outlook.
PG  - e36290
LID - 10.7759/cureus.36290 [doi]
LID - e36290
AB  - Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been the gold standard treatment for end stage 
      arthritis of knee. The advancements in techniques have allowed successful 
      outcomes. The use of closed negative suction drain in TKA has been controversial. 
      Entrapment of a drain following TKA with a broken drain has been reported rarely 
      though it has important implications.&nbsp; An obese 65-year-old female presented with 
      painful bilateral knees. A clinic-radiological assessment confirmed an advanced 
      grade osteoarthritis (OA). A single stage bilateral TKA was done. The use of 
      closed negative suction drain for both knees was done as a routine protocol. The 
      left knee drain got entrapped and an inadvertent pull due to abnormal positioning 
      in flexed knee impinged and broke the drain. The right knee removal of drain on 
      the second post-operative day was uneventful. A radiological assessment confirmed 
      the position of the broken drain in left knee. A mini arthrotomy ensued with 
      removal of the drain piece. Subsequent post-operative period was uneventful. The 
      knee function recovered with painless full range of motion. There was no evidence 
      of infection or implant loosening noted at a two-year follow-up. The generative 
      text model ChatGPT (OpenAI, USA) was used to identify the implication with the 
      use of drains in TKA. The use of drains remains controversial with no clear 
      consensus on its regular use. The breakage of drain poses an immediate concern 
      with need for wound revision and removal of foreign body. The long-term 
      observation for any knee infection, stiffness or poor knee function needs 
      monitoring. The early identification can prevent late symptomatology.&nbsp; The closed 
      negative suction drain in our practice has become selective and presently has an 
      infrequent use in TKA. An entrapment of a closed negative suction drain merits 
      urgent measures. The remedial measures may ensure to preserve the knee joint 
      function and maintain the ability to do activities of daily living.

AB  - This statement revises our earlier "WAME Recommendations on ChatGPT and Chatbots 
      in Relation to Scholarly Publications" (January 20, 2023). The revision reflects 
      the proliferation of chatbots and their expanding use in scholarly publishing 
      over the last few months, as well as emerging concerns regarding lack of 
      authenticity of content when using chatbots. These recommendations are intended 
      to inform editors and help them develop policies for the use of chatbots in 
      papers published in their journals. They aim to help authors and reviewers 
      understand how best to attribute the use of chatbots in their work and to address 
      the need for all journal editors to have access to manuscript screening tools. In 
      this rapidly evolving field, we will continue to modify these recommendations as 
      the software and its applications develop.

AB  - Large language models (LLMs) are exhibiting remarkable performance in clinical 
      contexts, with exemplar results ranging from expert-level attainment in medical 
      examination questions to superior accuracy and relevance when responding to 
      patient queries compared to real doctors replying to queries on social media. The 
      deployment of LLMs in conventional health care settings is yet to be reported, 
      and there remains an open question as to what evidence should be required before 
      such deployment is warranted. Early validation studies use unvalidated surrogate 
      variables to represent clinical aptitude, and it may be necessary to conduct 
      prospective randomized controlled trials to justify the use of an LLM for 
      clinical advice or assistance, as potential pitfalls and pain points cannot be 
      exhaustively predicted. This viewpoint states that as LLMs continue to 
      revolutionize the field, there is an opportunity to improve the rigor of 
      artificial intelligence (AI) research to reward innovation, conferring real 
      benefits to real patients.

AB  - COVID-19 has brought significant changes to our political, social, and 
      technological landscape. This paper explores the emergence and global spread of 
      the disease and focuses on the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in containing 
      its transmission. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no scientific 
      presentation of the early pictorial representation of the disease's spread. 
      Additionally, we outline various domains where AI has made a significant impact 
      during the pandemic. Our methodology involves searching relevant articles on 
      COVID-19 and AI in leading databases such as PubMed and Scopus to identify the 
      ways AI has addressed pandemic-related challenges and its potential for further 
      assistance. While research suggests that AI has not fully realized its potential 
      against COVID-19, likely due to data quality and diversity limitations, we review 
      and identify key areas where AI has been crucial in preparing the fight against 
      any sudden outbreak of the pandemic. We also propose ways to maximize the 
      utilization of AI's capabilities in this regard.

TI  - Harnessing Code Interpreters for Enhanced Predictive Modeling: A Case Study on 
      High-Density Lipoprotein Level Estimation in Romanian Diabetic Patients.
LID - 10.3390/jpm13101466 [doi]
LID - 1466
AB  - Diabetes is a condition accompanied by the alteration of body parameters, 
      including those related to lipids like triglyceride (TG), low-density 
      lipoproteins (LDLs), and high-density lipoproteins (HDLs). The latter are grouped 
      under the term dyslipidemia and are considered a risk factor for cardiovascular 
      events. In the present work, we analyzed the complex relationships between twelve 
      parameters (disease status, age, sex, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, 
      diastolic blood pressure, TG, HDL, LDL, glucose, HbA1c levels, and disease onset) 
      of patients with diabetes from Romania. An initial prospective analysis showed 
      that HDL is inversely correlated with most of the parameters; therefore, we 
      further analyzed the dependence of HDLs on the other factors. The analysis was 
      conducted with the Code Interpreter plugin of ChatGPT, which was used to build 
      several models from which Random Forest performed best. The principal predictors 
      of HDLs were TG, LDL, and HbA1c levels. Random Forest models were used to model 
      all parameters, showing that blood pressure and HbA1c can be predicted based on 
      the other parameters with the least error, while the less predictable parameters 
      were TG and LDL levels. By conducting the present study using the ChatGPT Code 
      Interpreter, we show that elaborate analysis methods are at hand and easy to 
      apply by researchers with limited computational resources. The insight that can 
      be gained from such an approach, such as what we obtained on HDL level predictors 
      in diabetes, could be relevant for deriving novel management strategies and 
      therapeutic approaches.

TI  - Treatment Outcomes of Leiomyosarcoma Metastasis Affecting the Brachial Plexus: A 
      Comparative Case Report Using Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT).

AB  - Sarcomas are a rare type of cancer that can develop in various parts of the body, 
      including the brachial plexus. Leiomyosarcomas (LMs) are a subtype of sarcoma 
      that develops in smooth muscle tissue and can metastasize to different parts of 
      the body. In this case report, we present two patients with LM metastasized to 
      the brachial plexus, one treated with CyberKnife (Accuray, Sunnyvale, CA) 
      stereotactic radiosurgery (CK SRS) and the other with surgical resection. The aim 
      of this case report is to present the treatment outcomes and adverse effects of 
      CK SRS and surgical resection in brachial plexus LM metastasis. Patient 1 was a 
      39-year-old female who received CK SRS, and at three months of follow-up, the 
      lesion was smaller, and she reported symptomatic improvement. At 15 months, the 
      lesion was stable in size, and there was no evidence of local invasion of the 
      adjacent vascular structures or nerves. Patient 2 was a 52-year-old male who 
      underwent surgical resection, and at one-month follow-up, the patient was 
      asymptomatic with no recurrence of his symptoms. The size of the residual 
      axillary tumor was stable at three months and showed a slight interval decrease 
      in size at five months of follow-up. He was followed for over 12 months, with no 
      recurrence of his symptoms. Both treatments appear to have been effective in 
      controlling LM growth and relieving symptoms. CK SRS provides a non-invasive 
      option. However, more research is needed to fully understand the effectiveness 
      and safety of these treatments for brachial plexus sarcoma. This case report 
      highlights the importance of considering different treatment options for brachial 
      plexus sarcoma and the need for further studies to understand the best approach 
      for these rare cases.

TI  - The future landscape of large language models in medicine.
PG  - 141

LID - 141
AB  - Large language models (LLMs) are artificial intelligence (AI) tools specifically 
      trained to process and generate text. LLMs attracted substantial public attention 
      after OpenAI's ChatGPT was made publicly available in November 2022. LLMs can 
      often answer questions, summarize, paraphrase and translate text on a level that 
      is nearly indistinguishable from human capabilities. The possibility to actively 
      interact with models like ChatGPT makes LLMs attractive tools in various fields, 
      including medicine. While these models have the potential to democratize medical 
      knowledge and facilitate access to healthcare, they could equally distribute 
      misinformation and exacerbate scientific misconduct due to a lack of 
      accountability and transparency. In this article, we provide a systematic and 
      comprehensive overview of the potentials and limitations of LLMs in clinical 
      practice, medical research and medical education.

TI  - Battle of the (Chat)Bots: Comparing Large Language Models to Practice Guidelines

AB  - Published guidelines and clinical practices vary when defining indications for 
      irradiation of blood components for the prevention of transfusion-associated 
      graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD). This study assessed irradiation indication 
      lists generated by multiple artificial intelligence (AI) programs, or chatbots, 
      and compared them to 2020 British Society for Haematology (BSH) practice 
      guidelines. Four chatbots (ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, Bard, and Bing Chat) were 
      prompted to list the indications for irradiation to prevent TA-GVHD. Responses 
      were graded for concordance with BSH guidelines. Chatbot response length, 
      discrepancies, and omissions were noted. Chatbot responses differed, but all were 
      relevant, short in length, generally more concordant than discordant with BSH 
      guidelines, and roughly complete. They lacked several indications listed in BSH 
      guidelines and notably differed in their irradiation eligibility criteria for 
      fetuses and neonates. The chatbots variably listed erroneous indications for 
      TA-GVHD prevention, such as patients receiving blood from a donor who is of a 
      different race or ethnicity. This study demonstrates the potential use of 
      generative AI for transfusion medicine and hematology topics but underscores the 
      risk of chatbot medical misinformation. Further study of risk factors for 
      TA-GVHD, as well as the applications of chatbots in transfusion medicine and 
      hematology, is warranted.

TI  - Reliability of large language models in managing odontogenic sinusitis clinical 
      scenarios: a preliminary multidisciplinary evaluation.
PG  - 1835-1841
LID - 10.1007/s00405-023-08372-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the utility of large language model (LLM) 
      artificial intelligence tools, Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) 
      versions 3.5 and 4, in managing complex otolaryngological clinical scenarios, 
      specifically for the multidisciplinary management of odontogenic sinusitis (ODS). 
      METHODS: A prospective, structured multidisciplinary specialist evaluation was 
      conducted using five ad hoc designed ODS-related clinical scenarios. LLM 
      responses to these scenarios were critically reviewed by a multidisciplinary 
      panel of eight specialist evaluators (2 ODS experts, 2 rhinologists, 2 general 
      otolaryngologists, and 2 maxillofacial surgeons). Based on the level of 
      disagreement from panel members, a Total Disagreement Score (TDS) was calculated 
      for each LLM response, and TDS comparisons were made between ChatGPT3.5 and 
      ChatGPT4, as well as between different evaluators. RESULTS: While disagreement to 
      some degree was demonstrated in 73/80 evaluator reviews of LLMs' responses, TDSs 
      were significantly lower for ChatGPT4 compared to ChatGPT3.5. Highest TDSs were 
      found in the case of complicated ODS with orbital abscess, presumably due to 
      increased case complexity with dental, rhinologic, and orbital factors affecting 
      diagnostic and therapeutic options. There were no statistically significant 
      differences in TDSs between evaluators' specialties, though ODS experts and 
      maxillofacial surgeons tended to assign higher TDSs. CONCLUSIONS: LLMs like 
      ChatGPT, especially newer versions, showed potential for complimenting 
      evidence-based clinical decision-making, but substantial disagreement was still 
      demonstrated between LLMs and clinical specialists across most case examples, 
      suggesting they are not yet optimal in aiding clinical management decisions. 
      Future studies will be important to analyze LLMs' performance as they evolve over 
      time.

AB  - Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the global landscape of 
      technology beyond natural language processing. Owing to their extensive 
      pre-training on vast datasets, contemporary LLMs can handle tasks ranging from 
      general functionalities to domain-specific areas, such as radiology, without 
      additional fine-tuning. General-purpose chatbots based on LLMs can optimize the 
      efficiency of radiologists in terms of their professional work and research 
      endeavors. Importantly, these LLMs are on a trajectory of rapid evolution, 
      wherein challenges such as "hallucination," high training cost, and efficiency 
      issues are addressed, along with the inclusion of multimodal inputs. In this 
      review, we aim to offer conceptual knowledge and actionable guidance to 
      radiologists interested in utilizing LLMs through a succinct overview of the 
      topic and a summary of radiology-specific aspects, from the beginning to 
      potential future directions.

TI  - Discordance of the Urinary and Pleural Fluid Antigen Test and False Positive for 
      Streptococcus pneumoniae in Empyema Secondary to Necrotizing Bacterial Pneumonia.
PG  - e37458
LID - 10.7759/cureus.37458 [doi]
LID - e37458
AB  - Empyema is a severe complication of pneumonia with high morbidity and mortality 
      rates. Rapid diagnosis and tailoring of antibiotic therapy are crucial to 
      treatment success for these severe bacterial lung infections. A&nbsp;Streptococcus 
      pneumoniae&nbsp;(S. pneumonia) antigen test drawn from the pleural fluid rather than a 
      urine sample has been found to have equivalent diagnostic utility to the urinary 
      antigen test. Discordance between these tests is rare. We report a case of a 
      69-year-old female with CT imaging findings consistent with empyema and a 
      bronchopulmonary fistula. A rapid&nbsp;S.&nbsp;pneumonia&nbsp;antigen test was negative from the 
      urinary sample but positive when drawn from a patient's pleural fluid sample. 
      Final pleural fluid cultures resulted in&nbsp;Streptococcus constellatus 
      (S.&nbsp;constellatus). This case demonstrates discordance between the results of 
      urinary and pleural fluid&nbsp;S. pneumoniae&nbsp;antigen tests, representing a potential 
      pitfall in using rapid antigen testing on pleural fluid samples. False positives 
      for the&nbsp;S.&nbsp;pneumoniae&nbsp;antigen in patients with viridans streptococci infections 
      have been documented due to the cross-reactivity of cell wall proteins in 
      different streptococcal species. Physicians encountering bacterial pneumonia of 
      unknown etiology complicated by empyema should understand the potential for 
      discordance and false positives using this diagnostic method.

TI  - Prior Restorative Procedures to Endodontic Treatment.
PG  - e37106
LID - 10.7759/cureus.37106 [doi]
LID - e37106
AB  - Tooth loss due to fracture and the failure of endodontic treatment (ET) are 
      common situations in teeth with extensive tissue destruction. This is due to the 
      fragility of the remaining dental structure and the difficulty in sealing 
      cavities, which is sometimes associated with the violation of the supracrestal 
      insertion tissue. The previous restoration of marginal ridges or cusps with 
      composite resin (CR) restores their fracture resistance, due to the adhesive 
      characteristics of the restorative material, while also protecting the quality of 
      endodontic treatment through better sealing. However, the protocol adopted in 
      teeth requiring endodontic treatment involves performing the restorative 
      procedure only after the endodontic procedures. The objective of this study was 
      to report a case in which restoration of marginal ridges and/or cusps was 
      performed prior to endodontic treatment, focusing on maintaining the tooth in 
      function without dental fracture. The restoration was performed with an inverted 
      operative sequence before the endodontic treatment. There was a violation of the 
      supracrestal insertion tissue, requiring crown lengthening surgery (CLS) prior to 
      the restorative procedure. Clinical and radiographic evaluations were performed 
      postoperatively at seven days, three, six, and nine months, and five years. Tooth 
      function was maintained without dental fractures or restoration loss. 
      Periradicular space healing occurred with the disappearance of the lesion. 
      Performing the restorative procedure prior to endodontic treatment in teeth with 
      extensive coronal destruction is an alternative technique that facilitates 
      clinical procedures, reduces the likelihood of dental loss due to fracture, and 
      promotes endodontic treatment success.

TI  - Use of Artificial Intelligence in Manuscript Preparation-AI as a Co-Author.
PG  - 1-12
LID - 10.11607/prd.7022 [doi]
AB  - The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly expanding. While it comes with 
      some drawbacks, it also offers numerous advantages. One significant application 
      of AI is chatbots, which utilize natural language processing and machine learning 
      to provide information, answer queries, and assist users. AI has various 
      applications and dentistry is no exception. The authors conducted an experiment 
      to assess the application of AI, particularly OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google Apps 
      Script, in various stages of information gathering and manuscript preparation in 
      parallel with conventional human-driven approaches. AI can serve as a valuable 
      instrument in manuscript preparation; however, relying solely or predominantly on 
      AI for manuscript writing is insufficient if the goal is to produce a 
      high-quality article for publication in a peer-reviewed, high-impact journal that 
      can contribute to the advancement of science and society.

TI  - AI-Powered Chatbots in Medical Education: Potential Applications and 
      Implications.
PG  - e43271
LID - 10.7759/cureus.43271 [doi]
LID - e43271
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is anticipated to have a considerable impact on the 
      routine practice of medicine, spanning from medical education to clinical 
      practice across specialties&nbsp;and, ultimately, patient care. With the imminent 
      widespread adoption of AI in medical practice, it is imperative that medical 
      schools adapt to the use of these advanced technologies in their curriculum to 
      produce future healthcare professionals who can seamlessly integrate these tools 
      into practice. Chatbots, AI systems programmed to process and generate human 
      language, are currently being evaluated for various tasks in medical education. 
      This paper explores the potential applications and implications of chatbots in 
      medical education, specifically in learning and research. With their capability 
      to summarize, simplify complex concepts, automate the creation of memory aids, 
      and serve as an interactive tutor and point-of-care medical reference, chatbots 
      have the potential to enhance students' comprehension, retention, and application 
      of medical knowledge in real-time. While the integration of AI-powered chatbots 
      in medical education presents numerous advantages, it is crucial for students to 
      use these tools as assistive tools rather than relying on them entirely. Chatbots 
      should be programmed to reference evidence-based medical resources and produce 
      precise and trustworthy content that adheres to medical science standards, 
      scientific writing guidelines, and ethical considerations.

AB  - Artificial intelligence is increasingly used in the field of medicine as a 
      diagnostic aid, particularly for image analysis and more generally for data 
      processing. Many artificial intelligence-based tools have been specifically 
      developed for clinical biology, but some more general ones can help to improve 
      the dissemination of medical knowledge. To test whether and to what extent an 
      automated conversation tool could answer questions on a clinical biology topic 
      (i.e. prostate cancer biomarkers), we questioned ChatGPT, an artificial 
      intelligence-powered model dedicated to optimize language models for dialogue. 
      Then we analyzed its responses.

TI  - Current safeguards, risk mitigation, and transparency measures of large language 
      models against the generation of health disinformation: repeated cross sectional 
      analysis.
PG  - e078538
LID - 10.1136/bmj-2023-078538 [doi]

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of safeguards to prevent large language 
      models (LLMs) from being misused to generate health disinformation, and to 
      evaluate the transparency of artificial intelligence (AI) developers regarding 
      their risk mitigation processes against observed vulnerabilities. DESIGN: 
      Repeated cross sectional analysis. SETTING: Publicly accessible LLMs. METHODS: In 
      a repeated cross sectional analysis, four LLMs (via chatbots/assistant 
      interfaces) were evaluated: OpenAI's GPT-4 (via ChatGPT and Microsoft's Copilot), 
      Google's PaLM 2 and newly released Gemini Pro (via Bard), Anthropic's Claude 2 
      (via Poe), and Meta's Llama 2 (via HuggingChat). In September 2023, these LLMs 
      were prompted to generate health disinformation on two topics: sunscreen as a 
      cause of skin cancer and the alkaline diet as a cancer cure. Jailbreaking 
      techniques (ie, attempts to bypass safeguards) were evaluated if required. For 
      LLMs with observed safeguarding vulnerabilities, the processes for reporting 
      outputs of concern were audited. 12 weeks after initial investigations, the 
      disinformation generation capabilities of the LLMs were re-evaluated to assess 
      any subsequent improvements in safeguards. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main 
      outcome measures were whether safeguards prevented the generation of health 
      disinformation, and the transparency of risk mitigation processes against health 
      disinformation. RESULTS: Claude 2 (via Poe) declined 130 prompts submitted across 
      the two study timepoints requesting the generation of content claiming that 
      sunscreen causes skin cancer or that the alkaline diet is a cure for cancer, even 
      with jailbreaking attempts. GPT-4 (via Copilot) initially refused to generate 
      health disinformation, even with jailbreaking attempts-although this was not the 
      case at 12 weeks. In contrast, GPT-4 (via ChatGPT), PaLM 2/Gemini Pro (via Bard), 
      and Llama 2 (via HuggingChat) consistently generated health disinformation blogs. 
      In September 2023 evaluations, these LLMs facilitated the generation of 113 
      unique cancer disinformation blogs, totalling more than 40 000 words, without 
      requiring jailbreaking attempts. The refusal rate across the evaluation 
      timepoints for these LLMs was only 5% (7 of 150), and as prompted the LLM 
      generated blogs incorporated attention grabbing titles, authentic looking (fake 
      or fictional) references, fabricated testimonials from patients and clinicians, 
      and they targeted diverse demographic groups. Although each LLM evaluated had 
      mechanisms to report observed outputs of concern, the developers did not respond 
      when observations of vulnerabilities were reported. CONCLUSIONS: This study found 
      that although effective safeguards are feasible to prevent LLMs from being 
      misused to generate health disinformation, they were inconsistently implemented. 
      Furthermore, effective processes for reporting safeguard problems were lacking. 
      Enhanced regulation, transparency, and routine auditing are required to help 
      prevent LLMs from contributing to the mass generation of health disinformation.

TI  - Large Language Models Facilitate the Generation of Electronic Health Record 
      Phenotyping Algorithms.
LID - 2023.12.19.23300230 [pii]
LID - 10.1101/2023.12.19.23300230 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Phenotyping is a core task in observational health research utilizing 
      electronic health records (EHRs). Developing an accurate algorithm demands 
      substantial input from domain experts, involving extensive literature review and 
      evidence synthesis. This burdensome process limits scalability and delays 
      knowledge discovery. We investigate the potential for leveraging large language 
      models (LLMs) to enhance the efficiency of EHR phenotyping by generating 
      high-quality algorithm drafts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prompted four LLMs-GPT-4 
      and GPT-3.5 of ChatGPT, Claude 2, and Bard-in October 2023, asking them to 
      generate executable phenotyping algorithms in the form of SQL queries adhering to 
      a common data model (CDM) for three phenotypes (i.e., type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
      dementia, and hypothyroidism). Three phenotyping experts evaluated the returned 
      algorithms across several critical metrics. We further implemented the top-rated 
      algorithms and compared them against clinician-validated phenotyping algorithms 
      from the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network. RESULTS: GPT-4 
      and GPT-3.5 exhibited significantly higher overall expert evaluation scores in 
      instruction following, algorithmic logic, and SQL executability, when compared to 
      Claude 2 and Bard. Although GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 effectively identified relevant 
      clinical concepts, they exhibited immature capability in organizing phenotyping 
      criteria with the proper logic, leading to phenotyping algorithms that were 
      either excessively restrictive (with low recall) or overly broad (with low 
      positive predictive values). CONCLUSION: GPT versions 3.5 and 4 are capable of 
      drafting phenotyping algorithms by identifying relevant clinical criteria aligned 
      with a CDM. However, expertise in informatics and clinical experience is still 
      required to assess and further refine generated algorithms.

TI  - PRISMA Systematic Literature Review, including with Meta-Analysis vs. Chatbot/GPT 
      (AI) regarding Current Scientific Data on the Main Effects of the Calf Blood 
      Deproteinized Hemoderivative Medicine (Actovegin) in Ischemic Stroke.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines11061623 [doi]
LID - 1623
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stroke is a significant public health problem and a leading cause of 
      death and long-term disability worldwide. Several treatments for ischemic stroke 
      have been developed, but these treatments have limited effectiveness. One 
      potential treatment for this condition is Actovegin(®)/AODEJIN, a calf blood 
      deproteinized hemodialysate/ultrafiltrate that has been shown to have 
      pleiotropic/multifactorial and possibly multimodal effects. The actual actions of 
      this medicine are thought to be mediated by its ability to reduce oxidative 
      stress, inflammation, and apoptosis and to enhance neuronal survival and 
      plasticity. METHODS: To obtain the most up-to-date information on the effects of 
      Actovegin(®)/AODEJIN in ischemic stroke, we systematically reviewed the 
      literature published in the last two years. This review builds upon our previous 
      systematic literature review published in 2020, which used the Preferred 
      Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method to 
      search for and select related articles over almost two decades, between 1 January 
      2001 and 31 December 2019. Additionally, we compared the results of our PRISMA 
      search (human intelligence-based) with those obtained from an interrogation of a 
      GPT-based chatbot (ChatGPT) in order to ensure comprehensive coverage of 
      potentially relevant studies. RESULTS: Our updated review found limited new 
      evidence on the use of Actovegin(®)/AODEJIN in ischemic stroke, although the 
      number of articles on this subject consistently increased compared to that from 
      our initial systematic literature review. Specifically, we found five articles up 
      to 2020 and eight more until December 2022. While these studies suggest that 
      Actovegin(®)/AODEJIN may have neuroprotective effects in ischemic stroke, further 
      clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings. Consequently, we performed 
      a funnel analysis to evaluate the potential for publication bias. DISCUSSION: Our 
      funnel analysis showed no evidence of publication bias, suggesting that the 
      limited number of studies identified was not due to publication bias but rather 
      due to a lack of research in this area. However, there are limitations when using 
      ChatGPT, particularly in distinguishing between truth and falsehood and 
      determining the appropriateness of interpolation. Nevertheless, AI can provide 
      valuable support in conducting PRISMA-type systematic literature reviews, 
      including meta-analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The limited number of studies identified in 
      our review highlights the need for additional research in this area, especially 
      as no available therapeutic agents are capable of curing central nervous system 
      lesions. Any contribution, including that of Actovegin (with consideration of a 
      positive balance between benefits and risks), is worthy of further study and 
      periodic reappraisal. The evolving advancements in AI may play a role in the near 
      future.

TI  - Ensemble pretrained language models to extract biomedical knowledge from 
      literature.
LID - ocae061 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocae061 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The rapid expansion of biomedical literature necessitates automated 
      techniques to discern relationships between biomedical concepts from extensive 
      free text. Such techniques facilitate the development of detailed knowledge bases 
      and highlight research deficiencies. The LitCoin Natural Language Processing 
      (NLP) challenge, organized by the National Center for Advancing Translational 
      Science, aims to evaluate such potential and provides a manually annotated corpus 
      for methodology development and benchmarking. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For the 
      named entity recognition (NER) task, we utilized ensemble learning to merge 
      predictions from three domain-specific models, namely BioBERT, PubMedBERT, and 
      BioM-ELECTRA, devised a rule-driven detection method for cell line and taxonomy 
      names and annotated 70 more abstracts as additional corpus. We further finetuned 
      the T0pp model, with 11 billion parameters, to boost the performance on relation 
      extraction and leveraged entites' location information (eg, title, background) to 
      enhance novelty prediction performance in relation extraction (RE). RESULTS: Our 
      pioneering NLP system designed for this challenge secured first place in Phase 
      I-NER and second place in Phase II-relation extraction and novelty prediction, 
      outpacing over 200 teams. We tested OpenAI ChatGPT 3.5 and ChatGPT 4 in a 
      Zero-Shot setting using the same test set, revealing that our finetuned model 
      considerably surpasses these broad-spectrum large language models. DISCUSSION AND 
      CONCLUSION: Our outcomes depict a robust NLP system excelling in NER and RE 
      across various biomedical entities, emphasizing that task-specific models remain 
      superior to generic large ones. Such insights are valuable for endeavors like 
      knowledge graph development and hypothesis formulation in biomedical research.

TI  - RARPKB: A knowledge-guide decision support platform for personalized 
      robot-assisted surgery in prostate cancer.
LID - 10.1097/JS9.0000000000001290 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) has emerged as a pivotal 
      surgical intervention for the treatment of prostate cancer. However, the 
      complexity of clinical cases, heterogeneity of prostate cancer, and limitations 
      in physician expertise pose challenges to rational decision-making in RARP. To 
      address these challenges, we aimed to organize the knowledge of previously 
      complex cohorts and establish an online platform named the RARP Knowledge Base 
      (RARPKB) to provide reference evidence for personalized treatment plans. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed searches over the past two decades were conducted 
      to identify publications describing RARP. We collected, classified, and 
      structured surgical details, patient information, surgical data, and various 
      statistical results from the literature. A knowledge-guided decision-support tool 
      was established using MySQL, DataTable, ECharts, and JavaScript. ChatGPT-4 and 
      two assessment scales were used to validate and compare the platform. RESULTS: 
      The platform comprised 583 studies, 1589 cohorts, 1 911 968 patients, and 11 986 
      records, resulting in 54 834 data entries. The knowledge-guided decision support 
      tool provide personalized surgical plan recommendations and potential

TI  - Can large language models help augment English psycholinguistic datasets?
LID - 10.3758/s13428-024-02337-z [doi]
AB  - Research on language and cognition relies extensively on psycholinguistic 
      datasets or "norms". These datasets contain judgments of lexical properties like 
      concreteness and age of acquisition, and can be used to norm experimental 
      stimuli, discover empirical relationships in the lexicon, and stress-test 
      computational models. However, collecting human judgments at scale is both 
      time-consuming and expensive. This issue of scale is compounded for 
      multi-dimensional norms and those incorporating context. The current work asks 
      whether large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to augment the creation of 
      large, psycholinguistic datasets in English. I use GPT-4 to collect multiple 
      kinds of semantic judgments (e.g., word similarity, contextualized sensorimotor 
      associations, iconicity) for English words and compare these judgments against 
      the human "gold standard". For each dataset, I find that GPT-4's judgments are 
      positively correlated with human judgments, in some cases rivaling or even 
      exceeding the average inter-annotator agreement displayed by humans. I then 
      identify several ways in which LLM-generated norms differ from human-generated 
      norms systematically. I also perform several "substitution analyses", which 
      demonstrate that replacing human-generated norms with LLM-generated norms in a 
      statistical model does not change the sign of parameter estimates (though in 
      select cases, there are significant changes to their magnitude). I conclude by 
      discussing the considerations and limitations associated with LLM-generated norms 
      in general, including concerns of data contamination, the choice of LLM, external 
      validity, construct validity, and data quality. Additionally, all of GPT-4's 
      judgments (over 30,000 in total) are made available online for further analysis.

TI  - NLP AI Models for Optimizing Medical Research: Demystifying the Concerns.
PG  - 854-858
LID - 10.1007/s13193-023-01791-z [doi]
AB  - Natural language processing (NLP) AI models have gained popularity in research; 
      however, ethical considerations are necessary to avoid potential negative 
      consequences. This paper identifies and explores the key areas of ethical concern 
      for researchers using NLP AI models, such as bias in training data and 
      algorithms, plagiarism, data privacy, accuracy of generated content, prompt and 
      content generation, and training data quality. To mitigate bias, researchers 
      should use diverse training data and regularly evaluate models for potential 
      biases. Proper attribution and privacy protection are essential when using 
      AI-generated content, while accuracy should be regularly tested and evaluated. 
      Specific and appropriate prompts, algorithms, and techniques should be used for 
      content generation, and training data quality should be high, diverse, and 
      updated regularly. Finally, appropriate authorship credit and avoidance of 
      conflicts of interest must be ensured. Adherence to ethical standards, such as 
      those outlined by ICMJE, is crucial. These ethical considerations are vital for 
      ensuring the quality and integrity of NLP AI model research and avoiding negative 
      consequences.

      Scholarly Journal Publishing.
PG  - 3-6
LID - 10.1002/hast.1507 [doi]
AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform many 
      aspects of scholarly publishing. Authors, peer reviewers, and editors might use 
      AI in a variety of ways, and those uses might augment their existing work or 
      might instead be intended to replace it. We are editors of bioethics and 
      humanities journals who have been contemplating the implications of this ongoing 
      transformation. We believe that generative AI may pose a threat to the goals that 
      animate our work but could also be valuable for achieving those goals. In the 
      interests of fostering a wider conversation about how generative AI may be used, 
      we have developed a preliminary set of recommendations for its use in scholarly 
      publishing. We hope that the recommendations and rationales set out here will 
      help the scholarly community navigate toward a deeper understanding of the 
      strengths, limits, and challenges of AI for responsible scholarly work.

      Decision-Making.

LID - e36415
AB  - This case report reflects on a delayed diagnosis for a 27-year-old woman who 
      reported chest pain and shortness of breath to the emergency department. The 
      treating clinician reflects upon how cognitive biases influenced their diagnostic 
      process and how multiple missed opportunities resulted in missteps. Using 
      artificial intelligence (AI) tools for clinical decision-making, we suggest how 
      AI could augment the clinician, and in this case, delayed diagnosis avoided. 
      Incorporating AI tools into clinical decision-making brings potential benefits, 
      including improved diagnostic accuracy and addressing human factors contributing 
      to medical errors. For example, they may support a real-time interpretation of 
      medical imaging and assist clinicians in generating a differential diagnosis in 
      ensuring that critical diagnoses are considered. However, it is vital to be aware 
      of the potential pitfalls associated with the use of AI, such as automation bias, 
      input data quality issues, limited clinician training in interpreting AI methods, 
      and the legal and ethical considerations associated with their use. The report 
      draws attention to the utility of AI clinical decision-support tools in 
      overcoming human cognitive biases. It also emphasizes the importance of 
      clinicians developing skills needed to steward the adoption of AI tools in 
      healthcare and serve as patient advocates, ensuring safe and effective use of 
      health data.

AB  - Mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) is an overlap syndrome characterized by 
      features of systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, and polymyositis, along 
      with the presence of the U1RNP antibody. A 46-year-old female patient&nbsp;presented 
      with severe anemia, cough, and breathlessness, and was diagnosed with cold 
      agglutinin disease, a type of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Autoimmune 
      workup revealed MCTD&nbsp;by positive antinuclear and U1RNP antibodies. She had 
      bilateral miliary mottling on X-ray and a tree-in-bud appearance on 
      high-resolution computed tomography of the thorax, which were suggestive of 
      pulmonary tuberculosis. Standard therapy with steroids was not advisable. She was 
      subsequently started on anti-tuberculosis treatment (anti-Koch's therapy), 
      followed by steroid therapy and immunosuppressive therapy after three weeks. The 
      patient responded well to treatment, but after two months, she developed 
      cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis.&nbsp;Adult-onset CMV disease may occur as a result of 
      primary infection, reinfection, or activation of a latent infection. Although not 
      directly related, it can occur as an atypical association in the setting of 
      immunosuppressive therapy. Morbidity and mortality are significantly increased in 
      this population secondary to infectious potentiation: immunosuppression causes 
      infections, and infections cause AIHA. The management of MCTD and secondary AIHA 
      and immunosuppression poses a therapeutic challenge.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence and Public Health: An Exploratory Study.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize research by 
      automating data analysis, generating new insights, and supporting the discovery 
      of new knowledge. The top 10 contribution areas of AI towards public health were 
      gathered in this exploratory study. We utilized the "text-davinci-003" model of 
      GPT-3, using OpenAI playground default parameters. The model was trained with the 
      largest training dataset any AI had, limited to a cut-off date in 2021. This 
      study aimed to test the ability of GPT-3 to advance public health and to explore 
      the feasibility of using AI as a scientific co-author. We asked the AI asked for 
      structured input, including scientific quotations, and reviewed responses for 
      plausibility. We found that GPT-3 was able to assemble, summarize, and generate 
      plausible text blocks relevant for public health concerns, elucidating valuable 
      areas of application for itself. However, most quotations were purely invented by 
      GPT-3 and thus invalid. Our research showed that AI can contribute to public 
      health research as a team member. According to authorship guidelines, the AI was 
      ultimately not listed as a co-author, as it would be done with a human 
      researcher. We conclude that good scientific practice also needs to be followed 
      for AI contributions, and a broad scientific discourse on AI contributions is 
      needed.

TI  - Cyberknife Radiosurgery for Synovial Sarcoma Metastasizing to the Spine: 
      Illustrative Case Reports.
PG  - e37087
LID - 10.7759/cureus.37087 [doi]
LID - e37087
AB  - Synovial sarcoma (SS) is a rare and aggressive type of soft tissue sarcoma that 
      commonly affects young adults. Metastasis in the spine is a rare complication, 
      and the management of these lesions is challenging. Radiosurgery is an 
      increasingly popular treatment option for spinal metastasis due to its ability to 
      deliver high doses of radiation to the target volume with minimal exposure to 
      surrounding healthy tissues. In this paper, we present two cases of SS with 
      spinal metastasis that were treated with CyberKnife radiosurgery (CKRS). The 
      first case was a 52-year-old female with a history of multiple thoracotomies and 
      lobectomies for lung metastases, who was diagnosed with T6-T8 and T4 spinal 
      metastasis. The second case was a 53-year-old female with Down syndrome, who was 
      diagnosed with T12-L1 spinal metastasis. Both patients experienced an improvement 
      in their symptoms following CKRS treatment and showed stable or decreasing lesion 
      sizes on follow-up imaging. The progression-free survival (PFS) in the first case 
      was 37 months and overall survival (OS) was 79 months. In the second case, the 
      PFS was 12 months and OS was 18 months. These cases highlight the potential 
      benefits of CKRS as a treatment option for SS with spinal metastasis and support 
      its use in the management of this challenging condition.

AB  - In a randomized, pre-post intervention study, we evaluated the influence of a 
      large language model (LLM) generative AI system on accuracy of physician 
      decision-making and bias in healthcare. 50 US-licensed physicians reviewed a 
      video clinical vignette, featuring actors representing different demographics (a 
      White male or a Black female) with chest pain. Participants were asked to answer 
      clinical questions around triage, risk, and treatment based on these vignettes, 
      then asked to reconsider after receiving advice generated by ChatGPT+ (GPT4). The 
      primary outcome was the accuracy of clinical decisions based on pre-established 
      evidence-based guidelines. Results showed that physicians are willing to change 
      their initial clinical impressions given AI assistance, and that this led to a 
      significant improvement in clinical decision-making accuracy in a chest pain 
      evaluation scenario without introducing or exacerbating existing race or gender 
      biases. A survey of physician participants indicates that the majority expect LLM 
      tools to play a significant role in clinical decision making.

TI  - Evaluating the Effectiveness of Artificial Intelligence-powered Large Language 
      Models Application in Disseminating Appropriate and Readable Health Information 
      in Urology.
PG  - 688-694

AB  - PURPOSE: The Internet is a ubiquitous source of medical information, and natural 
      language processors are gaining popularity as alternatives to traditional search 
      engines. However, suitability of their generated content for patients is not well 
      understood. We aimed to evaluate the appropriateness and readability of natural 
      language processor-generated responses to urology-related medical inquiries. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen patient questions were developed based on Google 
      Trends and were used as inputs in ChatGPT. Three categories were assessed: 
      oncologic, benign, and emergency. Questions in each category were either 
      treatment or sign/symptom-related questions. Three native English-speaking 
      Board-Certified urologists independently assessed appropriateness of ChatGPT 
      outputs for patient counseling using accuracy, comprehensiveness, and clarity as 
      proxies for appropriateness. Readability was assessed using the Flesch Reading 
      Ease and Flesh-Kincaid Reading Grade Level formulas. Additional measures were 
      created based on validated tools and assessed by 3 independent reviewers. 
      RESULTS: Fourteen of 18 (77.8%) responses were deemed appropriate, with clarity 
      having the most 4 and 5 scores (P = .01). There was no significant difference in 
      appropriateness of the responses between treatments and symptoms or between 
      different categories of conditions. The most common reason from urologists for 
      low scores was responses lacking information-sometimes vital information. The 
      mean (SD) Flesch Reading Ease score was 35.5 (SD=10.2) and the mean Flesh-Kincaid 
      Reading Grade Level score was 13.5 (1.74). Additional quality assessment scores 
      showed no significant differences between different categories of conditions. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Despite impressive capabilities, natural language processors have 
      limitations as sources of medical information. Refinement is crucial before 
      adoption for this purpose.

TI  - Can Artificial Intelligence aid communication? Considering the possibilities of 
      GPT-3 in Palliative care.
PG  - 418-425
LID - 10.25259/IJPC_155_2023 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This article reviews the developments in artificial intelligence (AI) 
      technologies and their current and prospective applications in endof-life 
      communications. It uses Open AI's generative pre-trained transformer 3 (GPT-3) as 
      a case study to understand the possibilities of AI-aided communication in 
      Palliative Care. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Open AI's GPT-3 was taken as a case study 
      where responses were generated through the GPT-3 beta playground (Davinci engine) 
      and were scrutinised by six mental health professionals (MHPs) working in a 
      palliative care setting in India. They were tasked to evaluate the responses 
      generated by the AI (the identity was not revealed until a part of the study was 
      completed) in a simulated palliative care conversation with another MHP posing as 
      a patient. The aim was to undermine whether the professionals were able to detect 
      that the responses were indeed generated by a machine and did they approve or 
      disapprove of the responses. RESULTS: The GPT-3 playground with the right prompts 
      produced remarkable, often surprising texts and responses that imitated human 
      interaction. However, glitches such as redundancy were noticed along with 
      strongly held opinions in certain questions related to faith, death, and life 
      after death. CONCLUSION: AI-assisted communication in palliative care could be 
      used to train professionals in the palliative care field using it as a simulation 
      in training. It could also be used as a therapeutic intervention for the purpose 
      of engagement and philosophical dialogue after certain modifications. However, it 
      would have its own limitations such as it cannot replace a human agent just yet.

TI  - HexAI-TJAtxt: A textual dataset to advance open scientific research in total 
      joint arthroplasty.
PG  - 109738
LID - 10.1016/j.dib.2023.109738 [doi]
LID - 109738
AB  - Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is the most common and fastest inpatient surgical 
      procedure in the elderly, nationwide. Due to the increasing number of TJA 
      patients and advancements in healthcare, there is a growing number of scientific 
      articles being published in a daily basis. These articles offer important 
      insights into TJA, covering aspects like diagnosis, prevention, treatment 
      strategies, and epidemiological factors. However, there has been limited effort 
      to compile a large-scale text dataset from these articles and make it publicly 
      available for open scientific research in TJA. Rapid yet, utilizing computational 
      text analysis on these large columns of scientific literatures holds great 
      potential for uncovering new knowledge to enhance our understanding of joint 
      diseases and improve the quality of TJA care and clinical outcomes. This work 
      aims to build a dataset entitled HexAI-TJAtxt, which includes more than 61,936 
      scientific abstracts collected from PubMed using MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) 
      terms within "MeSH Subheading" and "MeSH Major Topic," and Publication Date from 
      01/01/2000 to 12/31/2022. The current dataset is freely and publicly available at 
      https://github.com/pitthexai/HexAI-TJAtxt, and it will be updated frequently in 
      bi-monthly manner from new abstracts published at PubMed.

PG  - e35559
LID - 10.7759/cureus.35559 [doi]
LID - e35559
AB  - We present an uncommon case of a pediatric patient with sudden-onset 
      sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL), a medical condition in which a person 
      experiences a rapid loss of 30 or more decibels within a matter of hours or days. 
      The patient is a nine-year-old female who, two years prior, suddenly lost hearing 
      in her left ear after a 24-hour episode of nausea, vomiting, and left ear pain. 
      She presented to our clinic two years after the episode, long after the window 
      for evidence-based treatment for acute SSNHL, such as corticosteroid therapy or 
      antivirals, had passed. However, she remembered the moment of her hearing loss 
      vividly, an uncommon occurrence in pediatric patients. CT, MRI, family history, 
      and physical exam were unremarkable. The patient had a brief hearing aid trial 
      where she described being able to hear the sound but did not have any clarity in 
      understanding the sound. The patient was ultimately treated with a unilateral 
      cochlear implant and showed excellent subjective and audiogram responses. 
      Continued research on the management of SSNHL in pediatric patients who present 
      outside of the acute therapeutic window is needed.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence: its Future and Impact on Acute Medicine.
PG  - 150-153
AB  - This commentary explores the potential impact of artificial intelligence (AI) in 
      acute medicine, considering its possibilities and challenges. With its ability to 
      simulate human intelligence, AI holds the promise for supporting timely 
      decision-making and interventions in acute care. While AI has significantly 
      contributed to improvements in various sectors, its implementation in healthcare 
      remains limited. The development of AI tools tailored to acute medicine can 
      improve clinical decision-making, and AI's role in streamlining administrative 
      tasks, exemplified by ChatGPT, may offer immediate benefits. However, challenges 
      include uniform data collection, privacy, bias, and preserving the doctor-patient 
      relationship. Collaboration among AI researchers, healthcare professionals, and 
      policymakers is crucial to harness the potential of AI in acute medicine and 
      create a future where advanced technologies synergistically enhance human 
      expertise.

TI  - How are authors' contributions verified in the ICMJE model?
PG  - 1529-1530
LID - 10.1007/s00299-023-03022-9 [doi]
AB  - A recent editorial in Plant Cell Reports reaffirms what has been known for years, 
      namely, that it follows the four ICMJE clauses of authorship. That editorial even 
      provides a "perfect" model contribution statement. In this letter, I argue that 
      in reality and in practice, authorship delimitations are not that clear-cut, nor 
      are all contributions equal or equally weighted. More importantly, I opine that 
      no matter how eloquently an author contribution statement is written, editors 
      have no way to verify the veracity of those claims. In essence, absent authorship 
      contribution verification, the ICMJE guidelines are practically useless. The 
      responsibility for verification, even to determine authorship associated with 
      papermills or the "ghost" contribution of text by AI like ChatGPT, lies entirely 
      with editors and publishers. Although an unpopular meme, there is need for 
      academic publishing to return to a state of no blind trust.

AB  - In the evolving landscape of clinical Natural Language Generation (NLG), 
      assessing abstractive text quality remains challenging, as existing methods often 
      overlook generative task complexities. This work aimed to examine the current 
      state of automated evaluation metrics in NLG in healthcare. To have a robust and 
      well-validated baseline with which to examine the alignment of these metrics, we 
      created a comprehensive human evaluation framework. Employing ChatGPT-3.5-turbo 
      generative output, we correlated human judgments with each metric. None of the 
      metrics demonstrated high alignment; however, the SapBERT score-a Unified Medical 
      Language System (UMLS)-showed the best results. This underscores the importance 
      of incorporating domain-specific knowledge into evaluation efforts. Our work 
      reveals the deficiency in quality evaluations for generated text and introduces 
      our comprehensive human evaluation framework as a baseline. Future efforts should 
      prioritize integrating medical knowledge databases to enhance the alignment of 
      automated metrics, particularly focusing on refining the SapBERT score for 
      improved assessments.

TI  - The Gridlock Between Chronic Cerebral Venous Thrombosis and Dural Arteriovenous 
      Fistulas.
PG  - e35035
LID - 10.7759/cureus.35035 [doi]
LID - e35035
AB  - Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a rare condition that occurs when a blood 
      clot forms in the veins that drain blood from the brain. The incidence of CVT is 
      estimated to be 1.3-1.6 cases per 100,000 adults, with a higher prevalence in 
      females than males. Dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) are abnormal connections 
      between the dural sinuses and the venous system, which can occur as a 
      complication of CVT. The incidence of DAVFs after a diagnosis of CVT is reported 
      to be between 0.9 and 13%. It is believed that a thrombus in the cerebral venous 
      system causes stagnation of blood flow leading to an increase in venous pressure 
      and causing enlargement of pre-existing physiological arteriovenous shunts or 
      neoangiogenesis, resulting in the development of a DAVF. However, it is difficult 
      to establish a causal relationship between CVT and DAVF as most low-grade DAVFs 
      are asymptomatic and lack evidence. High-grade DAVFs are considered to be a more 
      serious form of the condition, as they are associated with a higher risk of 
      intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and other neurological complications. In our case 
      series of a total of two cases, all were diagnosed first with CVT, and later in 
      the follow-up imaging, chronic CVT with dural AV fistula was observed. This 
      highlights the importance of long-term follow-up imaging in patients with CVT to 
      detect any potential complications such as DAVF, especially in high-risk 
      patients, and to ensure the prompt treatment to prevent serious complications.

TI  - A rapid review on current and potential uses of large language models in nursing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The application of large language models across commercial and 
      consumer contexts has grown exponentially in recent years. However, a gap exists 
      in the literature on how large language models can support nursing practice, 
      education, and research. This study aimed to synthesize the existing literature 
      on current and potential uses of large language models across the nursing 
      profession. METHODS: A rapid review of the literature, guided by Cochrane rapid 
      review methodology and PRISMA reporting standards, was conducted. An expert 
      health librarian assisted in developing broad inclusion criteria to account for 
      the emerging nature of literature related to large language models. Three 
      electronic databases (i.e., PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase) were searched to identify 
      relevant literature in August 2023. Articles that discussed the development, use, 
      and application of large language models within nursing were included for 
      analysis. RESULTS: The literature search identified a total of 2028 articles that 
      met the inclusion criteria. After systematically reviewing abstracts, titles, and 
      full texts, 30 articles were included in the final analysis. Nearly all (93 %; 
      n = 28) of the included articles used ChatGPT as an example, and subsequently 
      discussed the use and value of large language models in nursing education (47 %; 
      n = 14), clinical practice (40 %; n = 12), and research (10 %; n = 3). While the 
      most common assessment of large language models was conducted by human evaluation 
      (26.7 %; n = 8), this analysis also identified common limitations of large 
      language models in nursing, including lack of systematic evaluation, as well as 
      other ethical and legal considerations. DISCUSSION: This is the first review to 
      summarize contemporary literature on current and potential uses of large language 
      models in nursing practice, education, and research. Although there are 
      significant opportunities to apply large language models, the use and adoption of 
      these models within nursing have elicited a series of challenges, such as ethical 
      issues related to bias, misuse, and plagiarism. CONCLUSION: Given the relative 
      novelty of large language models, ongoing efforts to develop and implement 
      meaningful assessments, evaluations, standards, and guidelines for applying large 
      language models in nursing are recommended to ensure appropriate, accurate, and 
      safe use. Future research along with clinical and educational partnerships is 
      needed to enhance understanding and application of large language models in 
      nursing and healthcare.

TI  - Giant Meckel's Diverticulum as a Cause of Post-traumatic Hemoperitoneum in a

AB  - Following the "rule of 2", Meckel's Diverticulum (MD) is 2 inches or 5cm long. 
      However, we report the case of an extremely large MD. To the best of our 
      elucidated literature search, it is the first case of Giant Meckel's Diverticulum 
      (GMD) from Pakistan presenting with post-traumatic hemoperitoneum. A 25-year-old 
      Pakistani male presented to a surgical emergency with a two-hour history of 
      generalized abdominal pain after blunt abdominal trauma. An exploratory 
      laparotomy was carried out due to the deranged hemodynamic parameters and free 
      fluid in the abdominopelvic cavity, revealing a 35 centimeters long MD with a 
      bleeding vessel on its tip. Diverticulectomy with the repair of a small 
      intestinal defect was performed after the evacuation of 2.5 liters of clotted 
      blood. Histologic evaluation revealed ectopic gastric tissue. He had an 
      uneventful post-operative stay and was discharged home. The current English 
      scientific literature has adequate case reports documenting the complications of 
      perforation, intestinal obstruction, and diverticulitis of Meckel's Diverticulum 
      (MD) of normal length. However, this case report highlights the significance of 
      an MD with an abnormal length which put the patient's life at risk of death in 
      the setting of normal intra-operative anatomy of all other abdominal organs.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence Systems Assisting in the Assessment of the Course and 
      Retention of Orthodontic Treatment.
LID - 10.3390/healthcare11050683 [doi]
LID - 683
AB  - This scoping review examines the contemporary applications of advanced artificial 
      intelligence (AI) software in orthodontics, focusing on its potential to improve 
      daily working protocols, but also highlighting its limitations. The aim of the 
      review was to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of current AI-based systems 
      compared to conventional methods in diagnosing, assessing the progress of 
      patients' treatment and follow-up stability. The researchers used various online 
      databases and identified diagnostic software and dental monitoring software as 
      the most studied software in contemporary orthodontics. The former can accurately 
      identify anatomical landmarks used for cephalometric analysis, while the latter 
      enables orthodontists to thoroughly monitor each patient, determine specific 
      desired outcomes, track progress, and warn of potential changes in pre-existing 
      pathology. However, there is limited evidence to assess the stability of 
      treatment outcomes and relapse detection. The study concludes that AI is an 
      effective tool for managing orthodontic treatment from diagnosis to retention, 
      benefiting both patients and clinicians. Patients find the software easy to use 
      and feel better cared for, while clinicians can make diagnoses more easily and 
      assess compliance and damage to braces or aligners more quickly and frequently.

      performance in both the triage of ophthalmology conditions and ophthalmology 
      knowledge assessment, underscoring their potential and areas for improvement. 
      However, assimilating these chatbots into the prevailing healthcare 
      infrastructures brings challenges. These encompass ethical dilemmas, legal 
      compliance, seamless integration with electronic health records (EHR), and 
      fostering effective dialogue with medical professionals. Addressing these 
      challenges necessitates the creation of bespoke standards and protocols for 
      ophthalmology chatbots. The horizon for these chatbots is illuminated by 
      advancements and anticipated innovations, poised to redefine the delivery of eye 
      care. The synergy of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) with 
      chatbots amplifies their diagnostic prowess. Additionally, their capability to 
      adapt linguistically and culturally ensures they can cater to a global patient 
      demographic. In this article, we explore in detail the utilization of chatbots in 
      ophthalmology, examining their accuracy, reliability, data protection, security, 
      transparency, potential algorithmic biases, and ethical considerations. We 
      provide a comprehensive review of their roles in the triage of ophthalmology 
      conditions and knowledge assessment, emphasizing their significance and future 
      potential in the field.

      AI-driven technologies such as computer vision, machine learning algorithms, and 
      robotic assistance facilitate preoperative planning, intraoperative guidance, and 
      postoperative monitoring. These advancements enable precise anatomical 
      measurements, personalized treatment plans, and real-time feedback during 
      surgery, leading to improved accuracy and safety. Furthermore, AI-powered image 
      analysis aids in facial recognition, skin texture assessment, and simulation of 
      surgical outcomes, enabling enhanced patient consultations and predictive 
      modeling. However, the integration of AI in plastic surgery also presents 
      challenges, including ethical concerns, data privacy, algorithm biases, and the 
      need for comprehensive training among healthcare professionals. Additionally, the 
      reliance on AI systems may potentially lead to over-reliance or reduced surgeon 
      autonomy, necessitating careful validation and continuous refinement of these 
      technologies. Despite these challenges, the synergistic collaboration between AI 
      and plastic surgery holds great promise in advancing clinical practice, fostering 
      innovation, and ultimately benefiting patients through optimized esthetic and 
      reconstructive outcomes.Level of Evidence V This journal requires that authors

AB  - The ChatGPT, a lite and conversational variant of Generative Pretrained 
      Transformer 4 (GPT-4) developed by OpenAI, is one of the milestone Large Language 
      Models (LLMs) with billions of parameters. LLMs have stirred up much interest 
      among researchers and practitioners in their impressive skills in natural 
      language processing tasks, which profoundly impact various fields. This paper 
      mainly discusses the future applications of LLMs in dentistry. We introduce two 
      primary LLM deployment methods in dentistry, including automated dental diagnosis 
      and cross-modal dental diagnosis, and examine their potential applications. 
      Especially, equipped with a cross-modal encoder, a single LLM can manage 
      multi-source data and conduct advanced natural language reasoning to perform 
      complex clinical operations. We also present cases to demonstrate the potential 
      of a fully automatic Multi-Modal LLM AI system for dentistry clinical 
      application. While LLMs offer significant potential benefits, the challenges, 
      such as data privacy, data quality, and model bias, need further study. Overall, 
      LLMs have the potential to revolutionize dental diagnosis and treatment, which 
      indicates a promising avenue for clinical application and research in dentistry.

TI  - Scarcity of research on psychological or psychiatric states using validated 
      questionnaires in low- and middle-income countries: A ChatGPT-assisted 
      bibliometric analysis and national case study on some psychometric properties.
PG  - 04102
LID - 10.7189/jogh.13.04102 [doi]
LID - 04102
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is vital to assess whether research on psychological or 
      psychiatric states using validated questionnaires is still lagging in low- and 
      middle-income countries and to what degree, and to continue to assess the 
      psychometric properties of the most informative questionnaires. METHODS: We 
      performed a bibliometric analysis of Web of Science Core Collection for all years 
      to determine the number of studies performed in each country that used an 
      inventory or a questionnaire on aggression, anxiety, depression, borderline 
      personality, narcissism, self-harm, shame, or childhood trauma. We conducted a 
      simple observational analysis of distributions by countries to derive the main 
      overall conclusions, assisted by ChatGPT to test its ability to summarise and 
      interpret this type of information. We also carried out a study in Croatia to 
      examine some psychometric properties of five commonly used questionnaires, using 
      Cronbach's α coefficient and zero-order correlations. RESULTS: We observed a 
      concentration of research activity in a few high-income countries, primarily the 
      United States and several European nations, suggesting a robust research 
      infrastructure and a strong emphasis on studying psychological and psychiatric 
      states within their population. In contrast, low- and middle-income countries 
      were notably under-represented in research on psychological and psychiatric 
      states, although the gap seems to be closing in some countries. Turkey, Iran, 
      Brazil, South Africa, Mexico, India, Malaysia and Pakistan have been consistently 
      contributing an increasing number of studies and catching up with the most 
      research-intensive high-income countries. The national case study in Croatia 
      confirmed adequate psychometric properties of the most frequently used 
      questionnaires. CONCLUSIONS: Addressing research gaps in low- and middle-income 
      countries is crucial, because relying solely on research from high-income 
      countries may not fully capture the nuances of psychological and psychiatric 
      states within diverse populations. To bridge this gap, it is essential to 
      prioritise mental health research in low-resource settings, provide training and 
      resources to local researchers, and establish international collaborations. Such 
      efforts can lead to the development of culturally valid questionnaires, an 
      improved understanding of psychological and psychiatric states in diverse 
      contexts, and the creation of effective interventions to promote mental 
      well-being on a global scale.

TI  - Evaluating the Efficacy of ChatGPT in Navigating the Spanish Medical Residency 
      Entrance Examination (MIR): Promising Horizons for AI in Clinical Medicine.

AB  - The rapid progress in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural 
      language processing has led to increasingly sophisticated large language models 
      (LLMs) for use in healthcare. This study assesses the performance of two LLMs, 
      the GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models, in passing the MIR medical examination for access 
      to medical specialist training in Spain. Our objectives included gauging the 
      model's overall performance, analyzing discrepancies across different medical 
      specialties, discerning between theoretical and practical questions, estimating 
      error proportions, and assessing the hypothetical severity of errors committed by 
      a physician. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied the 2022 Spanish MIR examination 
      results after excluding those questions requiring image evaluations or having 
      acknowledged errors. The remaining 182 questions were presented to the LLM GPT-4 
      and GPT-3.5 in Spanish and English. Logistic regression models analyzed the 
      relationships between question length, sequence, and performance. We also 
      analyzed the 23 questions with images, using GPT-4's new image analysis 
      capability. RESULTS: GPT-4 outperformed GPT-3.5, scoring 86.81% in Spanish (p &lt; 
      0.001). English translations had a slightly enhanced performance. GPT-4 scored 
      26.1% of the questions with images in English. The results were worse when the 
      questions were in Spanish, 13.0%, although the differences were not statistically 
      significant (p = 0.250). Among medical specialties, GPT-4 achieved a 100% correct 
      response rate in several areas, and the Pharmacology, Critical Care, and 
      Infectious Diseases specialties showed lower performance. The error analysis 
      revealed that while a 13.2% error rate existed, the gravest categories, such as 
      "error requiring intervention to sustain life" and "error resulting in death", 
      had a 0% rate. CONCLUSIONS: GPT-4 performs robustly on the Spanish MIR 
      examination, with varying capabilities to discriminate knowledge across 
      specialties. While the model's high success rate is commendable, understanding 
      the error severity is critical, especially when considering AI's potential role 
      in real-world medical practice and its implications for patient safety.

AB  - Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capability to 
      solve a wide range of tasks. However, despite their success across various tasks, 
      no prior work has investigated their capability in the biomedical domain yet. To 
      this end, this paper aims to evaluate the performance of LLMs on benchmark 
      biomedical tasks. For this purpose, a comprehensive evaluation of 4 popular LLMs 
      in 6 diverse biomedical tasks across 26 datasets has been conducted. To the best 
      of our knowledge, this is the first work that conducts an extensive evaluation 
      and comparison of various LLMs in the biomedical domain. Interestingly, we find 
      based on our evaluation that in biomedical datasets that have smaller training 
      sets, zero-shot LLMs even outperform the current state-of-the-art models when 
      they were fine-tuned only on the training set of these datasets. This suggests 
      that pre-training on large text corpora makes LLMs quite specialized even in the 
      biomedical domain. We also find that not a single LLM can outperform other LLMs 
      in all tasks, with the performance of different LLMs may vary depending on the 
      task. While their performance is still quite poor in comparison to the biomedical 
      models that were fine-tuned on large training sets, our findings demonstrate that 
      LLMs have the potential to be a valuable tool for various biomedical tasks that 
      lack large annotated data.

AB  - Amid ongoing health crisis, there is a growing necessity to discern possible 
      signs of Wellness Dimensions (WD) manifested in self-narrated text. As the 
      distribution of WD on social media data is intrinsically imbalanced, we 
      experiment the generative NLP models for data augmentation to enable further 
      improvement in the pre-screening task of classifying WD. To this end, we propose 
      a simple yet effective data augmentation approach through prompt-based Generative 
      NLP models, and evaluate the ROUGE scores and syntactic/semantic similarity among 
      existing interpretations and augmented data. Our approach with ChatGPT model 
      surpasses all the other methods and achieves improvement over baselines such as 
      Easy-Data Augmentation and Backtranslation. Introducing data augmentation to 
      generate more training samples and balanced dataset, results in the improved 
      F-score and the Matthew's Correlation Coefficient for upto 13.11% and 15.95%, 
      respectively.

LID - 10.1007/s11606-023-08497-6 [doi]
AB  - Medical interpretation is an underutilized resource, despite its legal mandate 
      and proven efficacy in improving health outcomes for populations with low English 
      proficiency. This disconnect can often be attributed to the costs and wait-times 
      associated with traditional means of interpretation, making the service 
      inaccessible and burdensome. Technology has improved access to translation 
      through phone and video interpretation; with the acceleration of artificial 
      intelligence (AI) large language models, we have an opportunity to further 
      improve interpreter access through real-time, automated translation. The impetus 
      to utilize this burgeoning tool for improved health equity must be combined with

      involved. Physicians must be active participants and collaborators in both the 
      mobilization of AI tools to improve clinical care and the development of 
      regulations to mitigate harm.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) broadly refers to machines that simulate intelligent 
      human behavior, and research into this field is exponential and worldwide, with 
      global players such as Microsoft battling with Google for supremacy and market 
      share. This paper reviews the "good" aspects of AI in medicine for individuals 
      who embrace the 4P model of medicine (Predictive, Preventive, Personalized, and 
      Participatory) to medical assistants in diagnostics, surgery, and research. The 
      "bad" aspects relate to the potential for errors, culpability, ethics, data loss 
      and data breaches, and so on. The "ugly" aspects are deliberate personal 
      malfeasances and outright scientific misconduct including the ease of plagiarism 
      and fabrication, with particular reference to the novel ChatGPT as well as AI 
      software that can also fabricate graphs and images. The issues pertaining to the 
      potential dangers of creating rogue, super-intelligent AI systems that lead to a 
      technological singularity and the ensuing perceived existential threat to mankind 
      by leading AI researchers are also briefly discussed.

TI  - Using artificial intelligence to create diverse and inclusive medical case 
      vignettes for education.
PG  - 640-648
LID - 10.1111/bcp.15977 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Medical case vignettes play a crucial role in medical education, yet they 
      often fail to authentically represent diverse patients. Moreover, these vignettes 
      tend to oversimplify the complex relationship between patient characteristics and 
      medical conditions, leading to biased and potentially harmful perspectives among 
      students. Displaying aspects of patient diversity, such as ethnicity, in written 
      cases proves challenging. Additionally, creating these cases places a significant 
      burden on teachers in terms of labour and time. Our objective is to explore the 
      potential of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted computer-generated clinical 
      cases to expedite case creation and enhance diversity, along with AI-generated 
      patient photographs for more lifelike portrayal. METHODS: In this study, we 
      employed ChatGPT (OpenAI, GPT 3.5) to develop diverse and inclusive medical case 
      vignettes. We evaluated various approaches and identified a set of eight 
      consecutive prompts that can be readily customized to accommodate local contexts 
      and specific assignments. To enhance visual representation, we utilized Adobe 
      Firefly beta for image generation. RESULTS: Using the described prompts, we 
      consistently generated cases for various assignments, producing sets of 30 cases 
      at a time. We ensured the inclusion of mandatory checks and formatting, 
      completing the process within approximately 60 min per set. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      approach significantly accelerated case creation and improved diversity, although 
      prioritizing maximum diversity compromised representativeness to some extent. 
      While the optimized prompts are easily reusable, the process itself demands 
      computer skills not all educators possess. To address this, we aim to share all 
      created patients as open educational resources, empowering educators to create 
      cases independently.

TI  - Rising adoption of artificial intelligence in scientific publishing: evaluating 
      the role, risks, and ethical implications in paper drafting and review process.
LID - 10.1515/cclm-2023-1136 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the rapid evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI), 
      scientific publishing is experiencing significant transformations. AI tools, 
      while offering unparalleled efficiencies in paper drafting and peer review, also 
      introduce notable ethical concerns. CONTENT: This study delineates AI's dual role 
      in scientific publishing: as a co-creator in the writing and review of scientific 
      papers and as an ethical challenge. We first explore the potential of AI as an 
      enhancer of efficiency, efficacy, and quality in creating scientific papers. A 
      critical assessment follows, evaluating the risks vs. rewards for researchers, 
      especially those early in their careers, emphasizing the need to maintain a 
      balance between AI's capabilities and fostering independent reasoning and 
      creativity. Subsequently, we delve into the ethical dilemmas of AI's involvement, 
      particularly concerning originality, plagiarism, and preserving the genuine 
      essence of scientific discourse. The evolving dynamics further highlight an 
      overlooked aspect: the inadequate recognition of human reviewers in the academic 
      community. With the increasing volume of scientific literature, tangible metrics 
      and incentives for reviewers are proposed as essential to ensure a balanced 
      academic environment. SUMMARY: AI's incorporation in scientific publishing is 
      promising yet comes with significant ethical and operational challenges. The role 
      of human reviewers is accentuated, ensuring authenticity in an AI-influenced 
      environment. OUTLOOK: As the scientific community treads the path of AI 
      integration, a balanced symbiosis between AI's efficiency and human discernment 
      is pivotal. Emphasizing human expertise, while exploit artificial intelligence 
      responsibly, will determine the trajectory of an ethically sound and efficient 
      AI-augmented future in scientific publishing.

AB  - Filoviruses, categorized as World Health Organization (WHO) Risk Group 4 (RG-4) 
      pathogens, represent significant global health risks due to their extraordinary 
      virulence. The Filoviridae family encompasses Ebola strains such as Sudan, Zaire, 
      Bundibugyo, Tai Forest (formerly known as Ivory Coast), Reston, and Bombali, in 
      addition to the closely related Marburg and Ravn virus strains. Filoviruses 
      originated from a common ancestor about 10,000 years ago and displayed remarkable 
      consistency in genetic heterogeneity until the 20th century. However, they 
      overcame a genetic bottleneck by mid-century. Paradoxically, this resulted in the 
      emergence of boosted virulent strains from the 1970's onward. Filovirus research 
      is included in the NIAID Biodefense Program and utilizes the highest level 
      specialized protective laboratories, Biosafety Laboratory (BSL)-4. The spread of 
      Filoviruses as well as other RG-4 pathogens within Africa poses a significant 
      health threat increasingly both in Africa and out of Africa.

AB  - In an age where technology is evolving at a sometimes incomprehensibly rapid 
      pace, the liver community must adjust and learn to embrace breakthroughs with an 
      open mind in order to benefit from potentially transformative influences on our 
      science and practice. The Journal of Hepatology has responded to novel 
      developments in artificial intelligence (AI) by recruiting experts in the field 
      to serve on the Editorial Board. Publications introducing novel AI technology are 
      no longer uncommon in our journal and are among the most highly debated and 
      possibly practice-changing papers across a broad range of scientific disciplines, 
      united by their focus on liver disease. As AI is rapidly evolving, this expert 
      paper will focus on educating our readership on large language models and their 
      possible impact on our research practice and clinical outlook, outlining both 
      challenges and opportunities in the field. "To improve is to change; to be 
      perfect is to change often." - Winston S. Churchill.

TI  - Assessing ChatGPT's Mastery of Bloom's Taxonomy Using Psychosomatic Medicine Exam 
      Questions: Mixed-Methods Study.
PG  - e52113
LID - 10.2196/52113 [doi]
LID - e52113
AB  - BACKGROUND: Large language models such as GPT-4 (Generative Pre-trained 
      Transformer 4) are being increasingly used in medicine and medical education. 
      However, these models are prone to "hallucinations" (ie, outputs that seem 
      convincing while being factually incorrect). It is currently unknown how these 
      errors by large language models relate to the different cognitive levels defined 
      in Bloom's taxonomy. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore how GPT-4 performs in 
      terms of Bloom's taxonomy using psychosomatic medicine exam questions. METHODS: 
      We used a large data set of psychosomatic medicine multiple-choice questions 
      (N=307) with real-world results derived from medical school exams. GPT-4 answered 
      the multiple-choice questions using 2 distinct prompt versions: detailed and 
      short. The answers were analyzed using a quantitative approach and a qualitative 
      approach. Focusing on incorrectly answered questions, we categorized reasoning 
      errors according to the hierarchical framework of Bloom's taxonomy. RESULTS: 
      GPT-4's performance in answering exam questions yielded a high success rate: 93% 
      (284/307) for the detailed prompt and 91% (278/307) for the short prompt. 
      Questions answered correctly by GPT-4 had a statistically significant higher 
      difficulty than questions answered incorrectly (P=.002 for the detailed prompt 
      and P&lt;.001 for the short prompt). Independent of the prompt, GPT-4's lowest exam 
      performance was 78.9% (15/19), thereby always surpassing the "pass" threshold. 
      Our qualitative analysis of incorrect answers, based on Bloom's taxonomy, showed 
      that errors were primarily in the "remember" (29/68) and "understand" (23/68) 
      cognitive levels; specific issues arose in recalling details, understanding 
      conceptual relationships, and adhering to standardized guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: 
      GPT-4 demonstrated a remarkable success rate when confronted with psychosomatic 
      medicine multiple-choice exam questions, aligning with previous findings. When 
      evaluated through Bloom's taxonomy, our data revealed that GPT-4 occasionally 
      ignored specific facts (remember), provided illogical reasoning (understand), or 
      failed to apply concepts to a new situation (apply). These errors, which were 
      confidently presented, could be attributed to inherent model biases and the 
      tendency to generate outputs that maximize likelihood.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence Can Generate Fraudulent but Authentic-Looking Scientific 
      Medical Articles: Pandora's Box Has Been Opened.
PG  - e46924
LID - 10.2196/46924 [doi]
LID - e46924
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) has advanced substantially in recent 
      years, transforming many industries and improving the way people live and work. 
      In scientific research, AI can enhance the quality and efficiency of data 
      analysis and publication. However, AI has also opened up the possibility of 
      generating high-quality fraudulent papers that are difficult to detect, raising 
      important questions about the integrity of scientific research and the 
      trustworthiness of published papers. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to 
      investigate the capabilities of current AI language models in generating 
      high-quality fraudulent medical articles. We hypothesized that modern AI models 
      can create highly convincing fraudulent papers that can easily deceive readers 
      and even experienced researchers. METHODS: This proof-of-concept study used 
      ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) powered by the GPT-3 
      (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) language model to generate a fraudulent 
      scientific article related to neurosurgery. GPT-3 is a large language model 
      developed by OpenAI that uses deep learning algorithms to generate human-like 
      text in response to prompts given by users. The model was trained on a massive 
      corpus of text from the internet and is capable of generating high-quality text 
      in a variety of languages and on various topics. The authors posed questions and 
      prompts to the model and refined them iteratively as the model generated the 
      responses. The goal was to create a completely fabricated article including the 
      abstract, introduction, material and methods, discussion, references, charts, 
      etc. Once the article was generated, it was reviewed for accuracy and coherence 
      by experts in the fields of neurosurgery, psychiatry, and statistics and compared 
      to existing similar articles. RESULTS: The study found that the AI language model 
      can create a highly convincing fraudulent article that resembled a genuine 
      scientific paper in terms of word usage, sentence structure, and overall 
      composition. The AI-generated article included standard sections such as 
      introduction, material and methods, results, and discussion, as well a data 
      sheet. It consisted of 1992 words and 17 citations, and the whole process of 
      article creation took approximately 1 hour without any special training of the 
      human user. However, there were some concerns and specific mistakes identified in 
      the generated article, specifically in the references. CONCLUSIONS: The study 
      demonstrates the potential of current AI language models to generate completely 
      fabricated scientific articles. Although the papers look sophisticated and 
      seemingly flawless, expert readers may identify semantic inaccuracies and errors 
      upon closer inspection. We highlight the need for increased vigilance and better 
      detection methods to combat the potential misuse of AI in scientific research. At 
      the same time, it is important to recognize the potential benefits of using AI 
      language models in genuine scientific writing and research, such as manuscript 
      preparation and language editing.

AB  - The growing presence of large language models (LLMs) in health care applications 
      holds significant promise for innovative advancements in patient care. However, 
      concerns about ethical implications and potential biases have been raised by 
      various stakeholders. Here, we evaluate the ethics of LLMs in medicine along 2 
      key axes: empathy and equity. We outline the importance of these factors in novel 
      models of care and develop frameworks for addressing these alongside LLM 
      deployment.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This paper provides an overview of generative artificial 
      intelligence (AI) and the possible implications in the delivery of mental health 
      care. RECENT FINDINGS: Generative AI is a powerful technology that is changing 
      rapidly. As psychiatrists, it is important for us to understand generative AI 
      technology and how it may impact our patients and our practice of medicine. This 
      paper aims to build this understanding by focusing on GPT-4 and its potential 
      impact on mental health care delivery. We first introduce key concepts and 
      terminology describing how the technology works and various novel uses of it. We 
      then dive into key considerations for GPT-4 and other large language models 
      (LLMs) and wrap up with suggested future directions and initial guidance to the 
      field.

      Consultation.
LID - ciad633 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciad633 [doi]
AB  - Large language models (LLMs) are artificial intelligence systems trained by deep 
      learning algorithms to process natural language and generate text responses to 
      user prompts. Some approach physician performance on a range of medical 
      challenges, leading some proponents to advocate for their potential use in 
      clinical consultation and prompting some consternation about the future of 
      cognitive specialties. However, LLMs currently have limitations that preclude 
      safe clinical deployment in performing specialist consultations, including 
      frequent confabulations, lack of contextual awareness crucial for nuanced 
      diagnostic and treatment plans, inscrutable and unexplainable training data and 
      methods, and propensity to recapitulate biases. Nonetheless, considering the 
      rapid improvement in this technology, growing calls for clinical integration, and 
      healthcare systems that chronically undervalue cognitive specialties, it is 
      critical that infectious diseases clinicians engage with LLMs to enable informed 
      advocacy for how they should-and shouldn't-be used to augment specialist care.

TI  - Evaluating Scoliosis Severity Based on Posturographic X-ray Images Using a 
      Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining Model.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics13132142 [doi]
LID - 2142
AB  - Assessing severe scoliosis requires the analysis of posturographic X-ray images. 
      One way to analyse these images may involve the use of open-source artificial 
      intelligence models (OSAIMs), such as the contrastive language-image pretraining 
      (CLIP) system, which was designed to combine images with text. This study aims to 
      determine whether the CLIP model can recognise visible severe scoliosis in 
      posturographic X-ray images. This study used 23 posturographic images of patients 
      diagnosed with severe scoliosis that were evaluated by two independent 
      neurosurgery specialists. Subsequently, the X-ray images were input into the CLIP 
      system, where they were subjected to a series of questions with varying levels of 
      difficulty and comprehension. The predictions obtained using the CLIP models in 
      the form of probabilities ranging from 0 to 1 were compared with the actual data. 
      To evaluate the quality of image recognition, true positives, false negatives, 
      and sensitivity were determined. The results of this study show that the CLIP 
      system can perform a basic assessment of X-ray images showing visible severe 
      scoliosis with a high level of sensitivity. It can be assumed that, in the 
      future, OSAIMs dedicated to image analysis may become commonly used to assess 
      X-ray images, including those of scoliosis.

TI  - [Making a diagnosis with the aid of the internet in times of large language 
      models].
LID - D7998 [pii]
AB  - The internet is an excellent aid in making diagnoses. One can retrieve diagnostic 
      information from a reliable source such as a continuously updated textbook or 
      search specifically for a diagnosis in bibliographic databases such as PubMed. 
      Entry of a patient summary in a general search engine or a large language model 
      such as ChatGPT can suggest differential-diagnoses to the expert user,but one 
      must be conscious of the limitations of current large language models. There 
      seems little room left for the traditional differential-diagnosis generators. 
      Ideally, large language models will be combined with transparent algorithms with 
      which medical data can be retrieved, to create a new generation of diagnostic 
      decision support systems.

TI  - Assessing Learning of Computer Programing Skills in the Age of Generative 
      Artificial Intelligence.
LID - 051003 [pii]
LID - 10.1115/1.4064364 [doi]
AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude 
      have recently become a concern in the delivery of engineering education. For 
      courses focused on computer coding, such tools are capable for creating working 
      computer code across a range of computer languages and computing platforms. In a 
      course for mechanical engineers focused on C++ coding for the Arduino 
      microcontroller and coding engineering problems in Matlab, a new approach to 
      assessment of programing homework assignments was developed. This assessment 
      moved the focus of assigned points from the correctness of the code to the effort 
      and understanding of the code demonstrated by the student during in-person 
      grading. Students who participated fully in in-person grading did significantly 
      better on a midterm exam. Relative to a previous semester, where grading was 
      focused on correct code, students had a slightly higher average midterm exam 
      score. This approach appears to be effective in supporting computational learning 
      in the face of evolving tools that could be used to circumvent learning. Future 
      work should examine how to also encourage responsible use of generative AI in 
      computational learning.

TI  - How children learn to understand language meanings: a neural model of adult-child 
      multimodal interactions in real-time.

AB  - This article describes a biological neural network model that can be used to 
      explain how children learn to understand language meanings about the perceptual 
      and affective events that they consciously experience. This kind of learning 
      often occurs when a child interacts with an adult teacher to learn language 
      meanings about events that they experience together. Multiple types of 
      self-organizing brain processes are involved in learning language meanings, 
      including processes that control conscious visual perception, joint attention, 
      object learning and conscious recognition, cognitive working memory, cognitive 
      planning, emotion, cognitive-emotional interactions, volition, and goal-oriented 
      actions. The article shows how all of these brain processes interact to enable 
      the learning of language meanings to occur. The article also contrasts these 
      human capabilities with AI models such as ChatGPT. The current model is called 
      the ChatSOME model, where SOME abbreviates Self-Organizing MEaning.

TI  - Identifying Group A Streptococcal Pharyngitis in Children Through Clinical 
      Variables Using Machine Learning.
PG  - e37141
LID - 10.7759/cureus.37141 [doi]
LID - e37141
AB  - Background Group A Streptococcus&nbsp;(GAS) is the most common bacterial cause of 
      pharyngitis in children.&nbsp;GAS pharyngitis requires antimicrobial agents, and rapid 
      antigen detection tests (RADTs) are currently considered useful for diagnosis. 
      However, the decision to perform the test is based on the pediatrician's 
      examination findings, but the indicators are not clear. Therefore, we used 
      machine learning (ML) to create a model to identify GAS pharyngitis from clinical 
      findings and to explore important features. Methods ML with Python programming 
      language was used for this study. Data from the included study involved 676 
      children aged 3 to 15 years diagnosed with pharyngitis, with positive results on 
      the RADT serving as exposures, and negative results serving as controls. The ML 
      performances served as the outcome. We utilized six types of ML classifiers, 
      namely, logistic regression, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor 
      algorithm, random forest, an ensemble of them, Voting Classifier, and the eXtreme 
      Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm. Additionally, we used SHapley Additive 
      exPlanations (SHAP) values to identify important features. Results Moderately 
      performing models were generated for all six ML classifiers. XGBoost produced the 
      best model, with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 
      0.75 ± 0.01. The order of important features in the model was palatal petechiae, 
      followed by scarlatiniform rash,&nbsp;tender cervical lymph nodes, and age. Conclusion 
      Through this study, we have demonstrated that ML models can predict childhood GAS 
      pharyngitis with moderate accuracy using only commonly recorded clinical 
      variables in children diagnosed with pharyngitis. We have also identified four 
      important clinical variables. These findings may serve as a reference for 
      considering indicators under the current guidelines recommended for selective 
      RADTs.

TI  - Evaluating the Diagnostic Accuracy and Management Recommendations of ChatGPT in 
      Uveitis.
PG  - 1-6
LID - 10.1080/09273948.2023.2253471 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Accurate diagnosis and timely management are vital for favorable 
      uveitis outcomes. Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds promise in medical 
      decision-making, particularly in ophthalmology. Yet, the diagnostic precision and 
      management advice from AI-based uveitis chatbots lack assessment. METHODS: We 
      appraised diagnostic accuracy and management suggestions of an AI-based chatbot, 
      ChatGPT, versus five uveitis-trained ophthalmologists, using 25 standard cases 
      aligned with new Uveitis Nomenclature guidelines. Participants predicted likely 
      diagnoses, two differentials, and next management steps. Comparative success 
      rates were computed. RESULTS: Ophthalmologists excelled (60-92%) in likely 
      diagnosis, exceeding AI (60%). Considering fully and partially accurate 
      diagnoses, ophthalmologists achieved 76-100% success; AI attained 72%. Despite an 
      8% AI improvement, its overall performance lagged. Ophthalmologists and AI agreed 
      on diagnosis in 48% cases, with 91.6% exhibiting concurrence in management plans. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The study underscores AI chatbots' potential in uveitis diagnosis 
      and management, indicating their value in reducing diagnostic errors. Further 
      research is essential to enhance AI chatbot precision in diagnosis and 
      recommendations.

TI  - Performance of GPT-4V in Answering the Japanese Otolaryngology Board 
      Certification Examination Questions: Evaluation Study.
PG  - e57054
LID - 10.2196/57054 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence models can learn from medical literature and 
      clinical cases and generate answers that rival human experts. However, challenges 
      remain in the analysis of complex data containing images and diagrams. OBJECTIVE: 
      This study aims to assess the answering capabilities and accuracy of ChatGPT-4 
      Vision (GPT-4V) for a set of 100 questions, including image-based questions, from 
      the 2023 otolaryngology board certification examination. METHODS: Answers to 100 
      questions from the 2023 otolaryngology board certification examination, including 
      image-based questions, were generated using GPT-4V. The accuracy rate was 
      evaluated using different prompts, and the presence of images, clinical area of 
      the questions, and variations in the answer content were examined. RESULTS: The 
      accuracy rate for text-only input was, on average, 24.7% but improved to 47.3% 
      with the addition of English translation and prompts (P&lt;.001). The average 
      nonresponse rate for text-only input was 46.3%; this decreased to 2.7% with the 
      addition of English translation and prompts (P&lt;.001). The accuracy rate was lower 
      for image-based questions than for text-only questions across all types of input, 
      with a relatively high nonresponse rate. General questions and questions from the 
      fields of head and neck allergies and nasal allergies had relatively high 
      accuracy rates, which increased with the addition of translation and prompts. In 
      terms of content, questions related to anatomy had the highest accuracy rate. For 
      all content types, the addition of translation and prompts increased the accuracy 
      rate. As for the performance based on image-based questions, the average of 
      correct answer rate with text-only input was 30.4%, and that with text-plus-image 
      input was 41.3% (P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: Examination of artificial intelligence's 
      answering capabilities for the otolaryngology board certification examination 
      improves our understanding of its potential and limitations in this field. 
      Although the improvement was noted with the addition of translation and prompts, 
      the accuracy rate for image-based questions was lower than that for text-based 
      questions, suggesting room for improvement in GPT-4V at this stage. Furthermore, 
      text-plus-image input answers a higher rate in image-based questions. Our 
      findings imply the usefulness and potential of GPT-4V in medicine; however, 
      future consideration of safe use methods is needed.

LID - 10.1016/j.joms.2024.03.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial Intelligence, by answering questions about disease 
      prevention strategies, can contribute to making diseases more treatable in their 
      early stages. PURPOSE: This study aims to evaluate the quality of patient 
      information by assessing the responses of the Chat Generative Pretrained 
      Transformer (ChatGPT, Open AI, USA) artificial intelligence model to questions 
      related to medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ). STUDY DESIGN, 
      SETTING, SAMPLE: The study was prospective cross-sectional design. The study was 
      conducted within the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. The study's 
      questions were prepared by an experienced oral and maxillofacial surgeon and 
      directed to the artificial intelligence platform. The responses were evaluated by 
      oral and maxillofacial surgeons using the Global Quality Scale (GQS). PREDICTOR 
      VARIABLE: The predictor variable is question type. A total of 120 questions were 
      categorized into six groups, which encompassed general information about MRONJ 
      (Group 1), queries from patients about to initiate medication therapy (Group 2), 
      questions from patients currently undergoing medication treatment (Group 3), 
      inquiries from patients who had completed medication usage (Group 4), general 
      treatment-related information (Group 5), and case scenarios (Group 6). MAIN 
      OUTCOME VARIABLES: The main variable is the GQS score. The GQS rates the quality 
      of information and its utility for the patients. The scores are as follows: Score 
      1: Poor quality, Score 2: Generally poor quality, Score 3: Moderate quality, 
      Score 4: Good quality, Score 5: Excellent quality. COVARIATES: Not applicable. 
      ANALYSES: Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests were applied for intragroup and 
      intergroup analyses. The statistical significance level was determined as P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;.05 
      and P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;.01. RESULTS: The average score for all questions was calculated to be 
      3.9&nbsp;±&nbsp;0.8, which is above the "moderate quality" threshold. Group 1 had a mean 
      score of 3.4&nbsp;±&nbsp;1.1; group 2 had 4.1&nbsp;±&nbsp;0.7; group 3 had 3.8&nbsp;±&nbsp;0.8; group 4 had 
      4.3&nbsp;±&nbsp;0.6; group 5 had 4.2&nbsp;±&nbsp;0.7; and group 6 had 4.1&nbsp;±&nbsp;0.5. The variations in 
      mean scores among these groups did not exhibit statistical significance 
      (P&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;.05). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: The artificial intelligence model has 
      generated responses of moderate quality to questions about MRONJ. The use of the 
      artificial intelligence platform may assist in patients gaining a fundamental 
      understanding of MRONJ.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) large language models (LLMs) such as 
      ChatGPT have demonstrated the ability to pass standardized exams. These models 
      are not trained for a specific task, but instead trained to predict sequences of 
      text from large corpora of documents sourced from the internet. It has been shown 
      that even models trained on this general task can pass exams in a variety of 
      domain-specific fields, including the United States Medical Licensing 
      Examination. We asked if large language models would perform as well on a much 
      narrower subdomain tests designed for medical specialists. Furthermore, we wanted 
      to better understand how progressive generations of GPT (generative pre-trained 
      transformer) models may be evolving in the completeness and sophistication of 
      their responses even while generational training remains general. In this study, 
      we evaluated the performance of two versions of GPT (GPT 3 and 4) on their 
      ability to pass the certification exam given to physicians to work as 
      osteoporosis specialists and become a certified clinical densitometrists. The CCD 
      exam has a possible score range of 150 to 400. To pass, you need a score of 300. 
      METHODS: A 100-question multiple-choice practice exam was obtained from a 3rd 
      party exam preparation website that mimics the accredited certification tests 
      given by the ISCD (International Society for Clinical Densitometry). The exam was 
      administered to two versions of GPT, the free version (GPT Playground) and 
      ChatGPT+, which are based on GPT-3 and GPT-4, respectively (OpenAI, San 
      Francisco, CA). The systems were prompted with the exam questions verbatim. If 
      the response was purely textual and did not specify which of the multiple-choice 
      answers to select, the authors matched the text to the closest answer. Each exam 
      was graded and an estimated ISCD score was provided from the exam website. In 
      addition, each response was evaluated by a rheumatologist CCD and ranked for 
      accuracy using a 5-level scale. The two GPT versions were compared in terms of 
      response accuracy and length. RESULTS: The average response length was 11.6 ±19 
      words for GPT-3 and 50.0±43.6 words for GPT-4. GPT-3 answered 62 questions 
      correctly resulting in a failing ISCD score of 289. However, GPT-4 answered 82 
      questions correctly with a passing score of 342. GPT-3 scored highest on the 
      "Overview of Low Bone Mass and Osteoporosis" category (72 % correct) while GPT-4 
      scored well above 80 % accuracy on all categories except "Imaging Technology in 
      Bone Health" (65 % correct). Regarding subjective accuracy, GPT-3 answered 23 
      questions with nonsensical or totally wrong responses while GPT-4 had no 
      responses in that category. CONCLUSION: If this had been an actual certification 
      exam, GPT-4 would now have a CCD suffix to its name even after being trained 
      using general internet knowledge. Clearly, more goes into physician training than 
      can be captured in this exam. However, GPT algorithms may prove to be valuable 
      physician aids in the diagnoses and monitoring of osteoporosis and other 
      diseases.

TI  - Personalized Medicine in Urolithiasis: AI Chatbot-Assisted Dietary Management of 
      Oxalate for Kidney Stone Prevention.
LID - 10.3390/jpm14010107 [doi]
LID - 107
AB  - Accurate information regarding oxalate levels in foods is essential for managing 
      patients with hyperoxaluria, oxalate nephropathy, or those susceptible to calcium 
      oxalate stones. This study aimed to assess the reliability of chatbots in 
      categorizing foods based on their oxalate content. We assessed the accuracy of 
      ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, Bard AI, and Bing Chat to classify dietary oxalate 
      content per serving into low (&lt;5 mg), moderate (5-8 mg), and high (&gt;8 mg) oxalate 
      content categories. A total of 539 food items were processed through each 
      chatbot. The accuracy was compared between chatbots and stratified by dietary 
      oxalate content categories. Bard AI had the highest accuracy of 84%, followed by 
      Bing (60%), GPT-4 (52%), and GPT-3.5 (49%) (p &lt; 0.001). There was a significant 
      pairwise difference between chatbots, except between GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 (p = 
      0.30). The accuracy of all the chatbots decreased with a higher degree of dietary 
      oxalate content categories but Bard remained having the highest accuracy, 
      regardless of dietary oxalate content categories. There was considerable 
      variation in the accuracy of AI chatbots for classifying dietary oxalate content. 
      Bard AI consistently showed the highest accuracy, followed by Bing Chat, GPT-4, 
      and GPT-3.5. These results underline the potential of AI in dietary management 
      for at-risk patient groups and the need for enhancements in chatbot algorithms 
      for clinical accuracy.

TI  - Artificial intelligence in academic writing and clinical pharmacy education: 
      consequences and opportunities.
LID - 10.1007/s11096-024-01705-1 [doi]
AB  - The current academic debate on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in 
      research and teaching has been ongoing since the launch of ChatGPT in November 
      2022. It mainly focuses on ethical considerations, academic integrity, authorship 
      and the need for new legal frameworks. Time efficiencies may allow for more 
      critical thinking, while ease of pattern recognition across large amounts of data 
      may promote drug discovery, better clinical decision making and guideline 
      development with resultant consequences for patient safety. AI is also prompting 
      a re-evaluation of the nature of learning and the purpose of education worldwide. 
      It challenges traditional pedagogies, forcing a shift from rote learning to more 
      critical, analytical, and creative thinking skills. Despite this opportunity to 
      re-think education concepts for pharmacy curricula several universities around 
      the world have banned its use. This commentary summarizes the existing debate and 
      identifies the consequences and opportunities for clinical pharmacy research and 
      education.

TI  - Augmenting interpretable models with large language models during training.
PG  - 7913
LID - 10.1038/s41467-023-43713-1 [doi]
LID - 7913
AB  - Recent large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have demonstrated 
      remarkable prediction performance for a growing array of tasks. However, their 
      proliferation into high-stakes domains and compute-limited settings has created a 
      burgeoning need for interpretability and efficiency. We address this need by 
      proposing Aug-imodels, a framework for leveraging the knowledge learned by LLMs 
      to build extremely efficient and interpretable prediction models. Aug-imodels use 
      LLMs during fitting but not during inference, allowing complete transparency and 
      often a speed/memory improvement of greater than 1000x for inference compared to 
      LLMs. We explore two instantiations of Aug-imodels in natural-language 
      processing: Aug-Linear, which augments a linear model with decoupled embeddings 
      from an LLM and Aug-Tree, which augments a decision tree with LLM feature 
      expansions. Across a variety of text-classification datasets, both outperform 
      their non-augmented, interpretable counterparts. Aug-Linear can even outperform 
      much larger models, e.g. a 6-billion parameter GPT-J model, despite having 
      10,000x fewer parameters and being fully transparent. We further explore 
      Aug-imodels in a natural-language fMRI study, where they generate interesting 
      interpretations from scientific data.

TI  - What generative AI means for trust in health communications.
PG  - 385-388
LID - 10.1080/17538068.2023.2277489 [doi]
AB  - ABSTRACTLarge language models are fundamental technologies used in interfaces 
      like ChatGPT and are poised to change the way people access and make sense of 
      health information. The speed of uptake and investment suggests that these will 
      be transformative technologies, but it is not yet clear what the implications 
      might be for health communications. In this viewpoint, we draw on research about 
      the adoption of new information technologies to focus on the ways that generative 
      artificial intelligence (AI) tools like large language models might change how 
      health information is produced, what health information people see, how marketing 
      and misinformation might be mixed with evidence, and what people trust. We 
      conclude that transparency and explainability in this space must be carefully 
      considered to avoid unanticipated consequences.

LID - 10.1101/2023.08.01.23293506 [doi]
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is used in an increasing number of areas, with 
      recent interest in generative AI, such as using ChatGPT to generate programming 
      code or DALL-E to make illustrations. We describe the use of generative AI in 
      medical education. Specifically, we sought to determine whether generative AI 
      could help train pediatric residents to better recognize genetic conditions. From 
      publicly available images of individuals with genetic conditions, we used 
      generative AI methods to create new images, which were checked for accuracy with 
      an external classifier. We selected two conditions for study, Kabuki (KS) and 
      Noonan (NS) syndromes, which are clinically important conditions that 
      pediatricians may encounter. In this study, pediatric residents completed 208 
      surveys, where they each classified 20 images following exposure to one of 4 
      possible educational interventions, including with and without generative AI 
      methods. Overall, we find that generative images perform similarly but appear to 
      be slightly less helpful than real images. Most participants reported that images 
      were useful, although real images were felt to be more helpful. We conclude that 
      generative AI images may serve as an adjunctive educational tool, particularly 
      for less familiar conditions, such as KS.

TI  - Exploring the Possible Use of AI Chatbots in Public Health Education: Feasibility 
      Study.
PG  - e51421
LID - 10.2196/51421 [doi]
LID - e51421
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly developing field with the 
      potential to transform various aspects of health care and public health, 
      including medical training. During the "Hygiene and Public Health" course for 
      fifth-year medical students, a practical training session was conducted on 
      vaccination using AI chatbots as an educational supportive tool. Before receiving 
      specific training on vaccination, the students were given a web-based test 
      extracted from the Italian National Medical Residency Test. After completing the 
      test, a critical correction of each question was performed assisted by AI 
      chatbots. OBJECTIVE: The main aim of this study was to identify whether AI 
      chatbots can be considered educational support tools for training in public 
      health. The secondary objective was to assess the performance of different AI 
      chatbots on complex multiple-choice medical questions in the Italian language. 
      METHODS: A test composed of 15 multiple-choice questions on vaccination was 
      extracted from the Italian National Medical Residency Test using targeted 
      keywords and administered to medical students via Google Forms and to different 
      AI chatbot models (Bing Chat, ChatGPT, Chatsonic, Google Bard, and YouChat). The 
      correction of the test was conducted in the classroom, focusing on the critical 
      evaluation of the explanations provided by the chatbot. A Mann-Whitney U test was 
      conducted to compare the performances of medical students and AI chatbots. 
      Student feedback was collected anonymously at the end of the training experience. 
      RESULTS: In total, 36 medical students and 5 AI chatbot models completed the 
      test. The students achieved an average score of 8.22 (SD 2.65) out of 15, while 
      the AI chatbots scored an average of 12.22 (SD 2.77). The results indicated a 
      statistically significant difference in performance between the 2 groups (U=49.5, 
      P&lt;.001), with a large effect size (r=0.69). When divided by question type 
      (direct, scenario-based, and negative), significant differences were observed in 
      direct (P&lt;.001) and scenario-based (P&lt;.001) questions, but not in negative 
      questions (P=.48). The students reported a high level of satisfaction (7.9/10) 
      with the educational experience, expressing a strong desire to repeat the 
      experience (7.6/10). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the efficacy of AI 
      chatbots in answering complex medical questions related to vaccination and 
      providing valuable educational support. Their performance significantly surpassed 
      that of medical students in direct and scenario-based questions. The responsible 
      and critical use of AI chatbots can enhance medical education, making it an 
      essential aspect to integrate into the educational system.

AB  - Incorporating generative artificial intelligence (GAI) in education has become 
      crucial in contemporary educational environments. This research article 
      thoroughly investigates the ramifications of implementing GAI in the higher 
      education context of Saudi Arabia, employing a blend of quantitative and 
      qualitative research approaches. Survey-based quantitative data reveals a 
      noteworthy correlation between educators' awareness of GAI and the frequency of 
      its application. Notably, around half of the surveyed educators are at stages 
      characterized by understanding and familiarity with GAI integration, indicating a 
      tangible readiness for its adoption. Moreover, the study's quantitative findings 
      underscore the perceived value and ease associated with integrating GAI, thus 
      reinforcing the assumption that educators are motivated and inclined to integrate 
      GAI tools like ChatGPT into their teaching methodologies. In addition to the 
      quantitative analysis, qualitative insights from in-depth interviews with 
      educators unveil a rich tapestry of perspectives. The qualitative data emphasizes 
      GAI's role as a catalyst for collaborative learning, contributing to professional 
      development, and fostering innovative teaching practices.

AB  - Biomedical research yields vast information, much of which is only accessible 
      through the literature. Consequently, literature search is crucial for healthcare 
      and biomedicine. Recent improvements in artificial intelligence (AI) have 
      expanded functionality beyond keywords, but they might be unfamiliar to 
      clinicians and researchers. In response, we present an overview of over 30 
      literature search tools tailored to common biomedical use cases, aiming at 
      helping readers efficiently fulfill their information needs. We first discuss 
      recent improvements and continued challenges of the widely used PubMed. Then, we 
      describe AI-based literature search tools catering to five specific information 
      needs: 1. Evidence-based medicine. 2. Precision medicine and genomics. 3. 
      Searching by meaning, including questions. 4. Finding related articles with 
      literature recommendation. 5. Discovering hidden associations through literature 
      mining. Finally, we discuss the impacts of recent developments of large language 
      models such as ChatGPT on biomedical information seeking.

AB  - Artificial intelligence and machine learning have numerous applications in 
      pathology and laboratory medicine. The release of ChatGPT prompted speculation 
      regarding the potentially transformative role of large-language models (LLMs) in 
      academic pathology, laboratory medicine, and pathology education. Because of the 
      potential to improve LLMs over the upcoming years, pathology and laboratory 
      medicine clinicians are encouraged to embrace this technology, identify pathways 
      by which LLMs may support our missions in education, clinical practice, and 
      research, participate in the refinement of AI modalities, and design 
      user-friendly interfaces that integrate these tools into our most important 
      workflows. Challenges regarding the use of LLMs, which have already received 
      considerable attention in a general sense, are also reviewed herein within the 
      context of the pathology field and are important to consider as LLM applications 
      are identified and operationalized.

AB  - Deployment of Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms for robotics applications in 
      the real world requires ensuring the safety of the robot and its environment. 
      Safe Robot RL (SRRL) is a crucial step toward achieving human-robot coexistence. 
      In this paper, we envision a human-centered SRRL framework consisting of three 
      stages: safe exploration, safety value alignment, and safe collaboration. We 
      examine the research gaps in these areas and propose to leverage interactive 
      behaviors for SRRL. Interactive behaviors enable bi-directional information 
      transfer between humans and robots, such as conversational robot ChatGPT. We 
      argue that interactive behaviors need further attention from the SRRL community. 
      We discuss four open challenges related to the robustness, efficiency, 
      transparency, and adaptability of SRRL with interactive behaviors.

TI  - Using Artificial Intelligence to Assess the Teratogenic Risk of Vitamin A 
      Supplements.
PG  - e45931
LID - 10.7759/cureus.45931 [doi]
LID - e45931
AB  - Vitamin A in high doses&nbsp;has been found to be highly teratogenic, leading to 
      severe fetal abnormalities if exposure occurs during pregnancy. Hence, 
      prescription vitamin A acne medications like isotretinoin&nbsp;are highly regulated 
      via programs such as iPledge, which intend to avert fetal exposure to 
      isotretinoin and to educate healthcare providers, pharmacists, and patients about 
      the significant risks associated with isotretinoin and its appropriate usage 
      conditions. However, over-the-counter (OTC) vitamin A supplements are not subject 
      to these requirements, and calculating the vitamin A content of these supplements 
      can be difficult due to the lack of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
      regulations and inconsistencies in labeling. If the necessary information is 
      provided, ChatGPT, a generative artificial intelligence (AI) tool, can help the 
      general public calculate the vitamin A content of supplements. Nonetheless, 
      supplement manufacturers do not always provide the data necessary for these 
      calculations.

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate and to raise awareness about the influence of AI-powered 
      software on the cognitive development of medical students, as well as the 
      possible long-term ramifications. METHOD: This study combed through the 
      literature on the use of AI in clinical settings and medical education, including 
      chatbots powered by AI such as Chatgpt and Dale. The potential advantages and 
      disadvantages of employing AI software for learning and complementing medical 
      education, as well as its influence on critical thinking and problem-solving 
      abilities, were assessed. RESULTS: no data analysis was performed. CONCLUSIONS: 
      AI-powered software in medical education has potential benefits and drawbacks. 
      While it can improve medical diagnosis and treatment and provide access to 
      learning resources, the misuse of AI as a shortcut may hinder cognitive 
      development and have long-term implications.

TI  - Cat Eye Syndrome with a Unique Liver and Dermatological Presentation.
PG  - e37142
LID - 10.7759/cureus.37142 [doi]
LID - e37142
AB  - Cat eye syndrome (CES), also known as Schmid-Fraccaro syndrome, is a complex 
      genetic syndrome with a highly variable phenotype that includes ocular coloboma, 
      anal atresia, preauricular skin tags and pits, heart defects, kidney 
      malformations, dysmorphic facial features, and mild to moderate intellectual 
      disability. We describe a case of a 23-year-old male with a past medical history 
      of CES with short stature, mild learning disability, and some dysmorphic facial 
      features who presented with recurrent&nbsp;pruritus and rashes and had mild liver 
      dysfunction. Furthermore, the patient did not have the classic presentation of 
      CES but a clinically milder expression of the phenotypes. Abnormalities in the 
      abdominal ultrasound prompted an ultrasound-guided liver biopsy, which showed 
      bile ductular proliferation with mild portal inflammation composed of lymphocytes 
      and plasma cells, and bridging fibrosis. The patient's labs showed elevated 
      immunoglobulins with the highest increase observed in IgG, along with negative 
      antinuclear antibodies&nbsp;(ANA), negative anti-mitochondrial antibody, and negative 
      hepatitis A/B/C but a weak positive anti-smooth muscle antibody (ASMA). These 
      findings indicated that the patient most likely had autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) or 
      an overlap syndrome with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). The patient was 
      initially treated with steroids and antihistamines for pruritus, which led to 
      some clinical improvement. After dermatological evaluation, the patient was 
      diagnosed with atopic dermatitis and was recently started on a dupilumab 600 mg 
      loading dose and would continue with biweekly dupilumab 300 mg injections. This 
      dermatological finding may require additional examination and can be a unique 
      presentation in patients with CES.&nbsp;This case illustrates that even patients with 
      milder CES expression can experience intense dermatological complications if not 
      effectively managed. CES is a multifactorial disease that requires intervention 
      from multiple specialists. Therefore, primary care physicians must be aware of 
      the potential complications of CES and make adequate referrals to closely monitor 
      patients' symptoms.

AB  - Computational language models (LMs), most notably exemplified by the widespread 
      success of OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot, show impressive performance on a wide range 
      of linguistic tasks, thus providing cognitive science and linguistics with a 
      computational working model to empirically study different aspects of human 
      language. Here, we use LMs to test the hypothesis that languages with more 
      speakers tend to be easier to learn. In two experiments, we train several 
      LMs-ranging from very simple n-gram models to state-of-the-art deep neural 
      networks-on written cross-linguistic corpus data covering 1293 different 
      languages and statistically estimate learning difficulty. Using a variety of 
      quantitative methods and machine learning techniques to account for phylogenetic 
      relatedness and geographical proximity of languages, we show that there is robust 
      evidence for a relationship between learning difficulty and speaker population 
      size. However, contrary to expectations derived from previous research, our 
      results suggest that languages with more speakers tend to be harder to learn.

TI  - Large language models and the future of rheumatology: assessing impact and 
      emerging opportunities.
PG  - 46-51
LID - 10.1097/BOR.0000000000000981 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Large language models (LLMs) have grown rapidly in size and 
      capabilities as more training data and compute power has become available. Since 
      the release of ChatGPT in late 2022, there has been growing interest and 
      exploration around potential applications of LLM technology. Numerous examples 
      and pilot studies demonstrating the capabilities of these tools have emerged 
      across several domains. For rheumatology professionals and patients, LLMs have 
      the potential to transform current practices in medicine. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent 
      studies have begun exploring capabilities of LLMs that can assist rheumatologists 
      in clinical practice, research, and medical education, though applications are 
      still emerging. In clinical settings, LLMs have shown promise in assist 
      healthcare professionals enabling more personalized medicine or generating 
      routine documentation like notes and letters. Challenges remain around 
      integrating LLMs into clinical workflows, accuracy of the LLMs and ensuring 
      patient data confidentiality. In research, early experiments demonstrate LLMs can 
      offer analysis of datasets, with quality control as a critical piece. Lastly, 
      LLMs could supplement medical education by providing personalized learning 
      experiences and integration into established curriculums. SUMMARY: As these 
      powerful tools continue evolving at a rapid pace, rheumatology professionals 
      should stay informed on how they may impact the field.

TI  - ChatGPT and large language models in academia: opportunities and challenges.
PG  - 20

LID - 20
AB  - The introduction of large language models&nbsp;(LLMs) that allow iterative "chat" in 
      late 2022 is a paradigm shift that enables generation of text often 
      indistinguishable from that written by humans. LLM-based chatbots have immense 
      potential to improve academic&nbsp;work efficiency, but the ethical implications of 
      their fair use and inherent bias must be considered. In this editorial, we 
      discuss this technology from the academic's perspective with regard to its 
      limitations and utility for academic writing, education, and programming. We end 
      with our stance with regard to using LLMs and chatbots in academia, which is 
      summarized as (1) we must find ways to effectively use them, (2) their use does 
      not constitute plagiarism (although they may produce plagiarized text), (3) we 
      must quantify their bias, (4) users must be cautious of their poor accuracy, and 
      (5) the future is bright for their application to research and as an academic 
      tool.

AB  - The large language model (LLM) ChatGPT has been shown to have considerable 
      utility across medicine and healthcare. This paper aims to explore the 
      capabilities of GPT-4 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4) in answering 
      Membership of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (MRCPCH) written 
      paper-style questions. GPT-4 was subjected to four publicly available sample 
      papers designed for those preparing to sit MRCPCH theory components. The model 
      received no specialised training or reinforcement. The average score across all 
      four papers was 78.1%. The model provided reasoning for its answers despite this 
      not being required by the questions. This performance strengthens the case for 
      incorporating LLMs into supporting roles for practising clinicians and medical 
      education in paediatrics.

AB  - Evaluating text-based answers obtained in educational settings or behavioral 
      studies is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Applying novel artificial 
      intelligence tools such as ChatGPT might support the process. Still, currently 
      available implementations do not allow for automated and case-specific 
      evaluations of large numbers of student answers. To counter this limitation, we 
      developed a flexible software and user-friendly web application that enables 
      researchers and educators to use cutting-edge artificial intelligence 
      technologies by providing an interface that combines large language models with 
      options to specify questions of interest, sample solutions, and evaluation 
      instructions for automated answer scoring. We validated the method in an 
      empirical study and found the software with expert ratings to have high 
      reliability. Hence, the present software constitutes a valuable tool to 
      facilitate and enhance text-based answer evaluation.•Generative AI-enhanced 
      software for customizable, case-specific, and automized grading of large amounts 
      of text-based answers.•Open-source software and web application for direct 
      implementation and adaptation.

AB  - The ability of recent Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to 
      generate human-like texts suggests that social scientists could use these LLMs to 
      construct measures of semantic similarity that match human judgment. In this 
      article, we provide an empirical test of this intuition. We use GPT-4 to 
      construct a measure of typicality-the similarity of a text document to a concept. 
      We evaluate its performance against other model-based typicality measures in 
      terms of the correlation with human typicality ratings. We conduct this 
      comparative analysis in two domains: the typicality of books in literary genres 
      (using an existing dataset of book descriptions) and the typicality of tweets 
      authored by US Congress members in the Democratic and Republican parties (using a 
      novel dataset). The typicality measure produced with GPT-4 meets or exceeds the 
      performance of the previous state-of-the art typicality measure we introduced in 
      a recent paper [G. Le Mens, B. Kovács, M. T. Hannan, G. Pros Rius, Sociol. Sci. 
      2023, 82-117 (2023)]. It accomplishes this without any training with the research 
      data (it is zero-shot learning). This is a breakthrough because the previous 
      state-of-the-art measure required fine-tuning an LLM on hundreds of thousands of 
      text documents to achieve its performance.

TI  - Evaluating the Performance of Different Large Language Models on Health 
      Consultation and Patient Education in Urolithiasis.
PG  - 125
LID - 10.1007/s10916-023-02021-3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of four large language models (LLMs) 
      (Claude, Bard, ChatGPT4, and New Bing) that have large user bases and significant 
      social attention, in the context of medical consultation and patient education in 
      urolithiasis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we developed a questionnaire 
      consisting of 21 questions and 2 clinical scenarios related to urolithiasis. 
      Subsequently, clinical consultations were simulated for each of the four models 
      to assess their responses to the questions. Urolithiasis experts then evaluated 
      the model responses in terms of accuracy, comprehensiveness, ease of 
      understanding, human care, and clinical case analysis ability based on a 
      predesigned 5-point Likert scale. Visualization and statistical analyses were 
      then employed to compare the four models and evaluate their performance. RESULTS: 
      All models yielded satisfying performance, except for Bard, who failed to provide 
      a valid response to Question 13. Claude consistently scored the highest in all 
      dimensions compared with the other three models. ChatGPT4 ranked second in 
      accuracy, with a relatively stable output across multiple tests, but shortcomings 
      were observed in empathy and human caring. Bard exhibited the lowest accuracy and 
      overall performance. Claude and ChatGPT4 both had a high capacity to analyze 
      clinical cases of urolithiasis. Overall, Claude emerged as the best performer in 
      urolithiasis consultations and education. CONCLUSION: Claude demonstrated 
      superior performance compared with the other three in urolithiasis consultation 
      and education. This study highlights the remarkable potential of LLMs in medical 
      health consultations and patient education, although professional review, further 
      evaluation, and modifications are still required.

      Intelligence in Medical Education: Scoping Review.
PG  - e48785
LID - 10.2196/48785 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are increasingly 
      being utilized across various fields, with considerable interest and concern 
      regarding their potential application in medical education. These technologies, 
      such as Chat GPT and Bard, can generate new content and have a wide range of 
      possible applications. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to synthesize the potential 
      opportunities and limitations of generative AI in medical education. It sought to 
      identify prevalent themes within recent literature regarding potential 
      applications and challenges of generative AI in medical education and use these 
      to guide future areas for exploration. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review, 
      following the framework by Arksey and O'Malley, of English language articles 
      published from 2022 onward that discussed generative AI in the context of medical 
      education. A literature search was performed using PubMed, Web of Science, and 
      Google Scholar databases. We screened articles for inclusion, extracted data from 
      relevant studies, and completed a quantitative and qualitative synthesis of the 
      data. RESULTS: Thematic analysis revealed diverse potential applications for 
      generative AI in medical education, including self-directed learning, simulation 
      scenarios, and writing assistance. However, the literature also highlighted 
      significant challenges, such as issues with academic integrity, data accuracy, 
      and potential detriments to learning. Based on these themes and the current state 
      of the literature, we propose the following 3 key areas for investigation: 
      developing learners' skills to evaluate AI critically, rethinking assessment 
      methodology, and studying human-AI interactions. CONCLUSIONS: The integration of 
      generative AI in medical education presents exciting opportunities, alongside 
      considerable challenges. There is a need to develop new skills and competencies 
      related to AI as well as thoughtful, nuanced approaches to examine the growing 
      use of generative AI in medical education.

TI  - Brain versus bot: Distinguishing letters of recommendation authored by humans 
      compared with artificial intelligence.
LID - 10.1002/aet2.10924 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Letters of recommendation (LORs) are essential within academic 
      medicine, affecting a number of important decisions regarding advancement, yet 
      these letters take significant amounts of time and labor to prepare. The use of 
      generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT, are gaining 
      popularity for a variety of academic writing tasks and offer an innovative 
      solution to relieve the burden of letter writing. It is yet to be determined if 
      ChatGPT could aid in crafting LORs, particularly in high-stakes contexts like 
      faculty promotion. To determine the feasibility of this process and whether there 
      is a significant difference between AI and human-authored letters, we conducted a 
      study aimed at determining whether academic physicians can distinguish between 
      the two. METHODS: A quasi-experimental study was conducted using a single-blind 
      design. Academic physicians with experience in reviewing LORs were presented with 
      LORs for promotion to associate professor, written by either humans or AI. 
      Participants reviewed LORs and identified the authorship. Statistical analysis 
      was performed to determine accuracy in distinguishing between human and 
      AI-authored LORs. Additionally, the perceived quality and persuasiveness of the 
      LORs were compared based on suspected and actual authorship. RESULTS: A total of 
      32 participants completed letter review. The mean accuracy of distinguishing 
      between human- versus AI-authored LORs was 59.4%. The reviewer's certainty and 
      time spent deliberating did not significantly impact accuracy. LORs suspected to 
      be human-authored were rated more favorably in terms of quality and 
      persuasiveness. A difference in gender-biased language was observed in our 
      letters: human-authored letters contained significantly more female-associated 
      words, while the majority of AI-authored letters tended to use more 
      male-associated words. CONCLUSIONS: Participants were unable to reliably 
      differentiate between human- and AI-authored LORs for promotion. AI may be able 
      to generate LORs and relieve the burden of letter writing for academicians. New 
      strategies, policies, and guidelines are needed to balance the benefits of AI 
      while preserving integrity and fairness in academic promotion decisions.

AB  - The Internet-of-Things (IoT)-based healthcare systems are comprised of a large 
      number of networked medical devices, wearables, and sensors that collect and 
      transmit data to improve patient care. However, the enormous number of networked 
      devices renders these systems vulnerable to assaults. To address these 
      challenges, researchers advocated reducing execution time, leveraging 
      cryptographic protocols to improve security and avoid assaults, and utilizing 
      energy-efficient algorithms to minimize energy consumption during computation. 
      Nonetheless, these systems still struggle with long execution times, assaults, 
      excessive energy usage, and inadequate security. We present a novel whale-based 
      attribute encryption scheme (WbAES) that empowers the transmitter and receiver to 
      encrypt and decrypt data using asymmetric master key encryption. The proposed 
      WbAES employs attribute-based encryption (ABE) using whale optimization algorithm 
      behaviour, which transforms plain data to ciphertexts and adjusts the whale 
      fitness to generate a suitable master public and secret key, ensuring security 
      against unauthorized access and manipulation. The proposed WbAES is evaluated 
      using patient health record (PHR) datasets collected by IoT-based sensors, and 
      various attack scenarios are established using Python libraries to validate the 
      suggested framework. The simulation outcomes of the proposed system are compared 
      to cutting-edge security algorithms and achieved finest performance in terms of 
      reduced 11&nbsp;s of execution time for 20 sensors, 0.121&nbsp;mJ of energy consumption, 
      850 Kbps of throughput, 99.85&nbsp;% of accuracy, and 0.19&nbsp;ms of computational cost.

TI  - The Potential of GPT-4 as a Support Tool for Pharmacists: Analytical Study Using 
      the Japanese National Examination for Pharmacists.
PG  - e48452
LID - 10.2196/48452 [doi]
LID - e48452
AB  - BACKGROUND: The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), as well as machine 
      learning, has led to its application in various industries, including health 
      care. AI chatbots, such as GPT-4, developed by OpenAI, have demonstrated 
      potential in supporting health care professionals by providing medical 
      information, answering examination questions, and assisting in medical education. 
      However, the applicability of GPT-4 in the field of pharmacy remains unexplored. 
      OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate GPT-4's ability to answer questions from 
      the Japanese National Examination for Pharmacists (JNEP) and assess its potential 
      as a support tool for pharmacists in their daily practice. METHODS: The question 
      texts and answer choices from the 107th and 108th JNEP, held in February 2022 and 
      February 2023, were input into GPT-4. As GPT-4 cannot process diagrams, questions 
      that included diagram interpretation were not analyzed and were initially given a 
      score of 0. The correct answer rates were calculated and compared with the 
      passing criteria of each examination to evaluate GPT-4's performance. RESULTS: 
      For the 107th and 108th JNEP, GPT-4 achieved an accuracy rate of 64.5% (222/344) 
      and 62.9% (217/345), respectively, for all questions. When considering only the 
      questions that GPT-4 could answer, the accuracy rates increased to 78.2% 
      (222/284) and 75.3% (217/287), respectively. The accuracy rates tended to be 
      lower for physics, chemistry, and calculation questions. CONCLUSIONS: Although 
      GPT-4 demonstrated the potential to answer questions from the JNEP and support 
      pharmacists' capabilities, it also showed limitations in handling highly 
      specialized questions, calculation questions, and questions requiring diagram 
      recognition. Further evaluation is necessary to explore its applicability in 
      real-world clinical settings, considering the complexities of patient scenarios 
      and collaboration with health care professionals. By addressing these 
      limitations, GPT-4 could become a more reliable tool for pharmacists in their 
      daily practice.

AB  - CONTEXT: Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot platforms are increasingly used by 
      patients as sources of information. However, there is limited data on the 
      performance of these platforms, especially regarding palliative care terms. 
      OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the accuracy, comprehensiveness, reliability, and 
      readability of three AI platforms in defining and differentiating "palliative 
      care," "supportive care," and "hospice care." METHODS: We asked ChatGPT, 
      Microsoft Bing Chat, Google Bard to define and differentiate "palliative care," 
      "supportive care," and "hospice care" and provide three references. Outputs were 
      randomized and assessed by six blinded palliative care physicians using 0-10 
      scales (10&nbsp;=&nbsp;best) for accuracy, comprehensiveness, and reliability. Readability 
      was assessed using Flesch Kincaid Grade Level and Flesch Reading Ease scores. 
      RESULTS: The mean (SD) accuracy scores for ChatGPT, Bard, and Bing Chat were 9.1 
      (1.3), 8.7 (1.5), and 8.2 (1.7), respectively; for comprehensiveness, the scores 
      for the three platforms were 8.7 (1.5), 8.1 (1.9), and 5.6 (2.0), respectively; 
      for reliability, the scores were 6.3 (2.5), 3.2 (3.1), and 7.1 (2.4), 
      respectively. Despite generally high accuracy, we identified some major errors 
      (e.g., Bard stated that supportive care had "the goal of prolonging life or even 
      achieving a cure"). We found several major omissions, particularly with Bing Chat 
      (e.g., no mention of interdisciplinary teams in palliative care or hospice care). 
      References were often unreliable. Readability scores did not meet recommended 
      levels for patient educational materials. CONCLUSION: We identified important 
      concerns regarding the accuracy, comprehensiveness, reliability, and readability 
      of outputs from AI platforms. Further research is needed to improve their 
      performance.

AB  - Intentional actions produce a temporal compression between the action and its 
      outcome, known as intentional binding. However, Suzuki et al. (2019) recently 
      showed that temporal compression can be observed without intentional actions. 
      However, their results show a clear regression to the mean, which might have 
      confounded the estimates of temporal intervals. To control these effects, we 
      presented temporal intervals block-wise. Indeed, we found systematically greater 
      compression for active than passive trials, in contrast to Suzuki et al. (2019). 
      In our second experiment, our goal was to conceptually replicate the previous 
      study. However, we were unable to reproduce their results and instead found more 
      pronounced temporal compression in active trials compared to passive ones. In a 
      subsequent attempt at a direct replication, we did not observe the same findings 
      as the original study. Our findings reinforce the theory that intentions rather 
      than causality cause temporal binding. During the preparation of this work, the 
      authors used ChatGPT in order to improve the readability of the paper. After 
      using this tool/service, the authors reviewed and edited the content as needed

AB  - Foundational models such as ChatGPT critically depend on vast data scales the 
      internet uniquely enables. This implies exposure to material varying widely in 
      logical sense, factual fidelity, moral value, and even legal status. Whereas data 
      scaling is a technical challenge, soluble with greater computational resource, 
      complex semantic filtering cannot be performed reliably without human 
      intervention: the self-supervision that makes foundational models possible at 
      least in part presupposes the abilities they seek to acquire. This unavoidably 
      introduces the need for large-scale human supervision-not just of training input 
      but also model output-and imbues any model with subjectivity reflecting the 
      beliefs of its creator. The pressure to minimize the cost of the former is in 
      direct conflict with the pressure to maximise the quality of the latter. 
      Moreover, it is unclear how complex semantics, especially in the realm of the 
      moral, could ever be reduced to an objective function any machine could plausibly 
      maximise. We suggest the development of foundational models necessitates urgent 
      innovation in quantitative ethics and outline possible avenues for its 
      realisation.

      artificial intelligence.
PG  - pgae035

LID - pgae035
AB  - The increasing availability of microtargeted advertising and the accessibility of 
      generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT, have raised 
      concerns about the potential misuse of large language models in scaling 
      microtargeting efforts for political purposes. Recent technological advancements, 
      involving generative AI and personality inference from consumed text, can 
      potentially create a highly scalable "manipulation machine" that targets 
      individuals based on their unique vulnerabilities without requiring human input. 
      This paper presents four studies examining the effectiveness of this putative 
      "manipulation machine." The results demonstrate that personalized political ads 
      tailored to individuals' personalities are more effective than nonpersonalized 
      ads (studies 1a and 1b). Additionally, we showcase the feasibility of 
      automatically generating and validating these personalized ads on a large scale 
      (studies 2a and 2b). These findings highlight the potential risks of utilizing AI 
      and microtargeting to craft political messages that resonate with individuals 
      based on their personality traits. This should be an area of concern to ethicists 
      and policy makers.

AB  - As the influence of transformer-based approaches in general and generative 
      artificial intelligence (AI) in particular continues to expand across various 
      domains, concerns regarding authenticity and explainability are on the rise. 
      Here, we share our perspective on the necessity of implementing effective 
      detection, verification, and explainability mechanisms to counteract the 
      potential harms arising from the proliferation of AI-generated inauthentic 
      content and science. We recognize the transformative potential of generative AI, 
      exemplified by ChatGPT, in the scientific landscape. However, we also emphasize 
      the urgency of addressing associated challenges, particularly in light of the 
      risks posed by disinformation, misinformation, and unreproducible science. This 
      perspective serves as a response to the call for concerted efforts to safeguard 
      the authenticity of information in the age of AI. By prioritizing detection, 
      fact-checking, and explainability policies, we aim to foster a climate of trust, 
      uphold ethical standards, and harness the full potential of AI for the betterment 
      of science and society.

TI  - From Free-text Drug Labels to Structured Medication Terminology with BERT and 
      GPT.
PG  - 540-549
AB  - We present a method to enrich controlled medication terminology from free-text 
      drug labels. This is important because, while controlled medication terminology 
      capture well-structured medication information, much of the information 
      pertaining to medications is still found in free-text. First, we compared 
      different Named Entity Recognition (NER) models including rule-based, 
      feature-based, deep learning-based models with Transformers as well as ChatGPT, 
      few-shot and fine-tuned GPT-3 to find the most suitable model that accurately 
      extracts medication entities (ingredients, brand, dose, etc.) from free-text. 
      Then, a rule-based Relation Extraction algorithm transforms NER results into a 
      well-structured medication knowledge graph. Finally, a Medication Searching 
      method takes the knowledge graph and matches it to relevant medications in the 
      terminology server. An empirical evaluation on real-world drug labels shows that 
      BERT-CRF was the most effective NER model with F-measure 95%. After performing 
      terms normalization, the Medication Searching achieved an accuracy of 77% for 
      when matching a label to relevant medication in the terminology server. The NER 
      and Medication Searching models could be deployed as a web service capable of 
      accepting free-text queries and returning structured medication information; thus 
      providing a useful means of better managing medications information found in 
      different health systems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Natural language processing (NLP) has experienced significant growth 
      in recent years and shows potential for broad impacts in scientific research and 
      clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: This study comprises an exploration of the role of 
      NLP in scientific research and its subsequent effects on traditional publication 
      practices, as well as an evaluation of the opportunities and challenges offered 
      by large language models (LLM) and a&nbsp;reflection on necessary paradigm shifts in 
      research culture. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Current LLMs, such as ChatGPT, and their 
      potential applications were compared and assessed. An analysis of the literature 
      and case studies on the integration of LLMs into scientific and clinical practice 
      was conducted. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: LLMs provide enhanced access to and 
      processing capabilities of text-based information and represent a&nbsp;vast potential 
      for (medical) research as well as daily clinical practice. Chat-based LLMs enable 
      efficient completion of often time-consuming tasks, but due to their tendency for 
      hallucinations, have a&nbsp;significant limitation. Current developments require 
      critical examination and a&nbsp;paradigm shift to fully exploit the benefits of LLMs 
      and minimize potential risks.

AB  - With the recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), patients are 
      increasingly exposed to misleading medical information. Generative AI models, 
      including large language models such as ChatGPT, create and modify text, images, 
      audio and video information based on training data. Commercial use of generative 
      AI is expanding rapidly and the public will routinely receive messages created by 
      generative AI. However, generative AI models may be unreliable, routinely make 
      errors and widely spread misinformation. Misinformation created by generative AI 
      about mental illness may include factual errors, nonsense, fabricated sources and 
      dangerous advice. Psychiatrists need to recognise that patients may receive 
      misinformation online, including about medicine and psychiatry.

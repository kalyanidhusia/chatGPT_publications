TI  - Bias and Inaccuracy in AI Chatbot Ophthalmologist Recommendations.
PG  - e45911
LID - 10.7759/cureus.45911 [doi]
LID - e45911
AB  - PURPOSE AND DESIGN: To evaluate the accuracy and bias of ophthalmologist 
      recommendations made by three AI chatbots, namely&nbsp;ChatGPT 3.5 (OpenAI, San 
      Francisco, CA, USA),&nbsp;Bing Chat (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA), and&nbsp;Google 
      Bard (Alphabet Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA). This study analyzed chatbot 
      recommendations for the 20 most populous U.S. cities. METHODS: Each chatbot 
      returned 80 total recommendations when given the prompt&nbsp;"Find me four good 
      ophthalmologists in (city)."&nbsp;Characteristics of the physicians, including 
      specialty, location, gender, practice type, and fellowship, were collected. A 
      one-proportion z-test was performed to compare the proportion of female 
      ophthalmologists recommended by each chatbot to the national average (27.2% per 
      the&nbsp;Association of American Medical Colleges&nbsp;(AAMC)). Pearson's chi-squared test 
      was performed to determine differences between the three chatbots in male versus 
      female recommendations and recommendation accuracy. RESULTS: Female 
      ophthalmologists recommended by Bing Chat (1.61%) and Bard (8.0%) were 
      significantly less than the national proportion of 27.2% practicing female 
      ophthalmologists (p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.01, respectively). ChatGPT recommended fewer 
      female (29.5%) than male ophthalmologists (p&lt;0.722). ChatGPT (73.8%), Bing Chat 
      (67.5%), and Bard (62.5%) gave high rates of inaccurate recommendations. Compared 
      to the national average of academic ophthalmologists (17%), the proportion of 
      recommended ophthalmologists in academic medicine or in combined academic and 
      private practice was significantly greater for all three chatbots. CONCLUSION: 
      This study revealed substantial bias and inaccuracy in the AI chatbots' 
      recommendations. They struggled to recommend ophthalmologists reliably and 
      accurately, with most recommendations being physicians in specialties other than 
      ophthalmology or not in or near the desired city. Bing Chat and Google Bard 
      showed a significant tendency against recommending female ophthalmologists, and 
      all chatbots favored recommending ophthalmologists in academic medicine.

TI  - ChatGPT on guidelines: Providing contextual knowledge to GPT allows it to provide 
      advice on appropriate colonoscopy intervals.
PG  - 81-106
LID - 10.1111/jgh.16375 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Colonoscopy is commonly used in screening and surveillance 
      for colorectal cancer. Multiple different guidelines provide recommendations on 
      the interval between colonoscopies. This can be challenging for non-specialist 
      healthcare providers to navigate. Large language models like ChatGPT are a 
      potential tool for parsing patient histories and providing advice. However, the 
      standard GPT model is not designed for medical use and can hallucinate. One way 
      to overcome these challenges is to provide contextual information with medical 
      guidelines to help the model respond accurately to queries. Our study compares 
      the standard GPT4 against a contextualized model provided with relevant screening 
      guidelines. We evaluated whether the models could provide correct advice for 
      screening and surveillance intervals for colonoscopy. METHODS: Relevant 
      guidelines pertaining to colorectal cancer screening and surveillance were 
      formulated into a knowledge base for GPT. We tested 62 example case scenarios 
      (three times each) on standard GPT4 and on a contextualized model with the 
      knowledge base. RESULTS: The contextualized GPT4 model outperformed the standard 
      GPT4 in all domains. No high-risk features were missed, and only two cases had 
      hallucination of additional high-risk features. A correct interval to colonoscopy 
      was provided in the majority of cases. Guidelines were appropriately cited in 
      almost all cases. CONCLUSIONS: A contextualized GPT4 model could identify 
      high-risk features and quote appropriate guidelines without significant 
      hallucination. It gave a correct interval to the next colonoscopy in the majority 
      of cases. This provides proof of concept that ChatGPT with appropriate refinement 
      can serve as an accurate physician assistant.

TI  - [Generative artificial intelligence and large language models in healthcare].
PG  - 54-59
AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) and large language models (LLM) made 
      their fulgurant irruption in our society at all levels, inclusive in health care. 
      Possible applications and proofs of concept are everywhere. There is without any 
      reasonable doubt an enormous potential, especially nowadays as we are facing an 
      ever-growing imbalance between the flux of data and the availability of human 
      resources. The creativity of GAI will be highlighted in the quest of defining 
      protein structures and search for new medications, as well as for the development 
      and use of digital twins in clinical research. As far as LLM's are concerned, we 
      need to make a distinction between general models and models dedicated 
      specifically to healthcare. Again, making an extensive overview of used cases is 
      becoming impossible today, facing the numerous publications in the field.

AB  - Invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae&nbsp;disease (IPD) remains a serious cause of 
      morbidity and loss of life in children and adults worldwide. While pneumococcal 
      vaccines have reduced the frequency of invasive pneumococcal disease, the 
      emergence of invasive non-vaccine serotypes has mandated the development of novel 
      pneumococcal vaccines to further protect against these emerging serotypes. We 
      present a case of a non-vaccine serotype invasive pneumococcal disease-causing 
      septic shock, meningitis, and stroke in a previously healthy and appropriately 
      vaccinated 23-month-old male.

TI  - Performance of ChatGPT, GPT-4, and Google Bard on a Neurosurgery Oral Boards 
      Preparation Question Bank.
PG  - 1090-1098
LID - 10.1227/neu.0000000000002551 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: General large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT 
      (GPT-3.5), have demonstrated the capability to pass multiple-choice medical board 
      examinations. However, comparative accuracy of different LLMs and LLM performance 
      on assessments of predominantly higher-order management questions is poorly 
      understood. We aimed to assess the performance of 3 LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and 
      Google Bard) on a question bank designed specifically for neurosurgery oral 
      boards examination preparation. METHODS: The 149-question Self-Assessment 
      Neurosurgery Examination Indications Examination was used to query LLM accuracy. 
      Questions were inputted in a single best answer, multiple-choice format. χ 2 , 
      Fisher exact, and univariable logistic regression tests assessed differences in 
      performance by question characteristics. RESULTS: On a question bank with 
      predominantly higher-order questions (85.2%), ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) and GPT-4 
      answered 62.4% (95% CI: 54.1%-70.1%) and 82.6% (95% CI: 75.2%-88.1%) of questions 
      correctly, respectively. By contrast, Bard scored 44.2% (66/149, 95% CI: 
      36.2%-52.6%). GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 demonstrated significantly higher scores than 
      Bard (both P &lt; .01), and GPT-4 outperformed GPT-3.5 ( P = .023). Among 6 
      subspecialties, GPT-4 had significantly higher accuracy in the Spine category 
      relative to GPT-3.5 and in 4 categories relative to Bard (all P &lt; .01). 
      Incorporation of higher-order problem solving was associated with lower question 
      accuracy for GPT-3.5 (odds ratio [OR] = 0.80, P = .042) and Bard (OR = 0.76, P = 
      .014), but not GPT-4 (OR = 0.86, P = .085). GPT-4's performance on 
      imaging-related questions surpassed GPT-3.5's (68.6% vs 47.1%, P = .044) and was 
      comparable with Bard's (68.6% vs 66.7%, P = 1.000). However, GPT-4 demonstrated 
      significantly lower rates of "hallucination" on imaging-related questions than 
      both GPT-3.5 (2.3% vs 57.1%, P &lt; .001) and Bard (2.3% vs 27.3%, P = .002). Lack 
      of question text description for questions predicted significantly higher odds of 
      hallucination for GPT-3.5 (OR = 1.45, P = .012) and Bard (OR = 2.09, P &lt; .001). 
      CONCLUSION: On a question bank of predominantly higher-order management case 
      scenarios for neurosurgery oral boards preparation, GPT-4 achieved a score of 
      82.6%, outperforming ChatGPT and Google Bard.

TI  - The now and future of ChatGPT and GPT in psychiatry.
PG  - 592-596
LID - 10.1111/pcn.13588 [doi]
AB  - ChatGPT has sparked extensive discussions within the healthcare community since 
      its November 2022 release. However, potential applications in the field of 
      psychiatry have received limited attention. Deep learning has proven beneficial 
      to psychiatry, and GPT is a powerful deep learning-based language model with 
      immense potential for this field. Despite the convenience of ChatGPT, this 
      advanced chatbot currently has limited practical applications in psychiatry. It 
      may be used to support psychiatrists in routine tasks such as completing medical 
      records, facilitating communications between clinicians and with patients, 
      polishing academic writings and presentations, and programming and performing 
      analyses for research. The current training and application of ChatGPT require 
      using appropriate prompts to maximize appropriate outputs and minimize 
      deleterious inaccuracies and phantom errors. Moreover, future GPT advances that 
      incorporate empathy, emotion recognition, personality assessment, and detection 
      of mental health warning signs are essential for its effective integration into 
      psychiatric care. In the near future, developing a fully-automated psychotherapy 
      system trained for expert communication (such as psychotherapy verbatim) is 
      conceivable by building on foundational GPT technology. This dream system should 
      integrate practical 'real world' inputs and friendly AI user and patient 
      interfaces via clinically validated algorithms, voice comprehension/generation 
      modules, and emotion discrimination algorithms based on facial expressions and 
      physiological inputs from wearable devices. In addition to the technology 
      challenges, we believe it is critical to establish generally accepted ethical 
      standards for applying ChatGPT-related tools in all mental healthcare 
      environments, including telemedicine and academic/training settings.

TI  - A Case of Unintentional Release of the Watchman FLX Device During Implantation: A 
      Cautionary Tale.
PG  - e36002
LID - 10.7759/cureus.36002 [doi]
LID - e36002
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart rhythm disorder that increases the 
      risk of stroke and other cardiovascular complications. The Watchman FLX device is 
      a percutaneous device used for the closure of the left atrial appendage in 
      patients with atrial fibrillation and prevents blood clots from forming, thereby 
      decreasing the risk of stroke. However, device dislodgement during the procedure 
      can occur and compromise the effectiveness of the device. In this case report, we 
      present the experience of an 86-year-old man with a history of atrial 
      fibrillation, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and recent gastrointestinal 
      bleeding due to diverticulosis. During the procedure, the device became dislodged 
      prior to the planned release from the shaft due to the difficult anatomy of the 
      appendage, which caused the operator to over-torque and kink&nbsp;the delivery sheath. 
      The kinked sheath prevented the transmission of torque to the appropriate region 
      of the sheath and caused the device to unscrew prematurely. Fortunately, the 
      device was self-deployed in a satisfactory position, and no further intervention 
      was required. The patient did not experience any complications prior to discharge 
      and follow-up echocardiography showed proper positioning of the device. This case 
      highlights the importance of careful technique during the Watchman FLX procedure 
      and the need to replace the delivery sheath if kinking is noted to prevent 
      unintentional dislodgement of the device. In addition, the case was written with 
      the aid of the artificial intelligence-powered language model ChatGPT and 
      demonstrates its benefits as well as calls for caution while using it for medical 
      writing.

TI  - Automated HEART score determination via ChatGPT: Honing a framework for iterative 
      prompt development.
PG  - e13133
LID - 10.1002/emp2.13133 [doi]
LID - e13133
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study presents a design framework to enhance the accuracy by 
      which large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT can extract insights from 
      clinical notes. We highlight this framework via prompt refinement for the 
      automated determination of HEART (History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, Troponin risk 
      algorithm) scores in chest pain evaluation. METHODS: We developed a pipeline for 
      LLM prompt testing, employing stochastic repeat testing and quantifying response 
      errors relative to physician assessment. We evaluated the pipeline for automated 
      HEART score determination across a limited set of 24 synthetic clinical notes 
      representing four simulated patients. To assess whether iterative prompt design 
      could improve the LLMs' ability to extract complex clinical concepts and apply 
      rule-based logic to translate them to HEART subscores, we monitored diagnostic 
      performance during prompt iteration. RESULTS: Validation included three iterative 
      rounds of prompt improvement for three HEART subscores with 25 repeat trials 
      totaling 1200 queries each for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. For both LLM models, from 
      initial to final prompt design, there was a decrease in the rate of responses 
      with erroneous, non-numerical subscore answers. Accuracy of numerical responses 
      for HEART subscores (discrete 0-2 point scale) improved for GPT-4 from the 
      initial to final prompt iteration, decreasing from a mean error of 0.16-0.10 (95% 
      confidence interval: 0.07-0.14) points. CONCLUSION: We established a framework 
      for iterative prompt design in the clinical space. Although the results indicate 
      potential for integrating LLMs in structured clinical note analysis, translation 
      to real, large-scale clinical data with appropriate data privacy safeguards is 
      needed.

TI  - The 2023 MANCTRA Acute Biliary Pancreatitis Care Bundle: A Joint Effort Between 
      Human Knowledge and Artificial Intelligence (ChatGPT) to Optimize the Care of 
      Patients With Acute Biliary Pancreatitis in Western Countries.
PG  - 203-212
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0000000000006008 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To generate an up-to-date bundle to manage acute biliary pancreatitis 
      using an evidence-based, artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted GRADE method. 
      BACKGROUND: A care bundle is a set of core elements of care that are distilled 
      from the most solid evidence-based practice guidelines and recommendations. 
      METHODS: The research questions were addressed in this bundle following the PICO 
      criteria. The working group summarized the effects of interventions with the 
      strength of recommendation and quality of evidence applying the GRADE 
      methodology. ChatGPT AI system was used to independently assess the quality of 
      evidence of each element in the bundle, together with the strength of the 
      recommendations. RESULTS: The 7 elements of the bundle discourage antibiotic 
      prophylaxis in patients with acute biliary pancreatitis, support the use of a 
      full-solid diet in patients with mild to moderately severe acute biliary 
      pancreatitis, and recommend early enteral nutrition in patients unable to feed by 
      mouth. The bundle states that endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography 
      should be performed within the first 48 to 72 hours of hospital admission in 
      patients with cholangitis. Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be performed 
      in patients with mild acute biliary pancreatitis. When operative intervention is 
      needed for necrotizing pancreatitis, this should start with the endoscopic 
      step-up approach. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a new care bundle with 7 key 
      elements for managing patients with acute biliary pancreatitis. This new bundle, 
      whose scientific strength has been increased thanks to the alliance between human 
      knowledge and AI from the new ChatGPT software, should be introduced to emergency 
      departments, wards, and intensive care units.

AB  - We present a case, written with the assistance of the Chat Generative 
      Pre-training Transformer (ChatGPT) Artificial Intelligence (AI), of a 75-year-old 
      female with a history of hypertension, epilepsy, coronary artery disease, and 
      alcohol use disorder. She presented with a tonic-clonic seizure, tachycardia, and 
      a cyanotic right hand. Diagnostic tests revealed stress-induced cardiomyopathy, 
      patent bilateral subclavian and axillary arteries with heavy calcification of 
      bilateral upper extremity arteries, and a small filling defect in the segmental 
      branch of the left lower lobe. The patient was started on antiepileptic 
      medication, thiamine/folate, and heparin drip for limb ischemia. Despite 
      treatment with multiple anti-arrhythmic agents, the patient developed cardiogenic 
      shock and underwent left heart catheterization with Impella placement. The 
      Impella was removed 72 hours after placement, and the patient was started on 
      low-dose Milrinone and Levophed for hemodynamic support. The patient eventually 
      recovered and was discharged to long-term acute care.

TI  - "You Are Not Alone": The Allure and Limitations of Artificial Intelligence in 
      Serious Illness Communication.
PG  - 7-9
LID - 10.1089/jpm.2023.0471 [doi]
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the way clinicians practice medicine, 
      and recent technological advancements have resulted in consumer-facing products 
      that can respond to users with dynamic and nuanced language. Clinicians typically 
      struggle with serious illness communication, such as delivering news about a poor 
      prognosis. Palliative care clinicians receive extensive training in serious 
      illness communication, but there is a paucity of such highly trained specialists. 
      This article explores the allure of employing AI-powered chatbots to assist 
      nonspecialist clinicians with serious illness communication and highlights the 
      ethical and practical drawbacks. While outsourcing communication to new AI 
      chatbot technologies may be inappropriate, there is a role for AI in training 
      clinicians on effective language to use when discussing serious illness with 
      their patients.

PG  - e38091
LID - 10.7759/cureus.38091 [doi]
LID - e38091
AB  - Scurvy is a multisystem disease caused by vitamin C deficiency, historically 
      associated with lethargy, gingivitis, ecchymosis, edema, and death if left 
      untreated. Contemporary socioeconomic risk factors for scurvy include smoking, 
      alcohol abuse, fad diets, mental health conditions, social isolation, and 
      economic marginalization. Food insecurity is also a risk factor. This report 
      describes a case of a man in his 70s who presented with unexplained dyspnea, 
      abdominal pain, and abdominal ecchymosis. His plasma vitamin C level was 
      undetectable, and he improved with vitamin C supplementation. This case 
      highlights the significance of awareness of these risk factors and emphasizes the 
      need for a comprehensive social and dietary history to enable the timely 
      treatment of this rare but potentially fatal disease.

LID - ocae014 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocae014 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Information retrieval (IR, also known as search) systems are 
      ubiquitous in modern times. How does the emergence of generative artificial 
      intelligence (AI), based on large language models (LLMs), fit into the IR 
      process? PROCESS: This perspective explores the use of generative AI in the 
      context of the motivations, considerations, and outcomes of the IR process with a 
      focus on the academic use of such systems. CONCLUSIONS: There are many 
      information needs, from simple to complex, that motivate use of IR. Users of such 
      systems, particularly academics, have concerns for authoritativeness, timeliness, 
      and contextualization of search. While LLMs may provide functionality that aids 
      the IR process, the continued need for search systems, and research into their 
      improvement, remains essential.

TI  - The Performance of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard on the Japanese National Dentist 
      Examination: A Comparison Study.
PG  - e50369
LID - 10.7759/cureus.50369 [doi]

AB  - Purpose This study aims to evaluate the performance of three large language 
      models (LLMs), the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)-3.5, GPT-4, and 
      Google Bard, on the 2023 Japanese National Dentist Examination (JNDE) and assess 
      their potential clinical applications in Japan. Methods A total of 185 questions 
      from the 2023 JNDE were used. These questions were categorized by question type 
      and category. McNemar's test compared the correct response rates between two 
      LLMs, while Fisher's exact test evaluated the performance of LLMs in each 
      question category. Results The overall correct response rates were 73.5% for 
      GPT-4, 66.5% for Bard, and 51.9% for GPT-3.5. GPT-4 showed a significantly higher 
      correct response rate than Bard and GPT-3.5. In the category of essential 
      questions, Bard achieved a correct response rate of 80.5%, surpassing the passing 
      criterion of 80%. In contrast, both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 fell short of this 
      benchmark, with GPT-4 attaining 77.6% and GPT-3.5 only 52.5%. The scores of GPT-4 
      and Bard were significantly higher than that of GPT-3.5 (p&lt;0.01). For general 
      questions, the correct response rates were 71.2% for GPT-4, 58.5% for Bard, and 
      52.5% for GPT-3.5. GPT-4 outperformed GPT-3.5 and Bard (p&lt;0.01). The correct 
      response rates for professional dental questions were 51.6% for GPT-4, 45.3% for 
      Bard, and 35.9% for GPT-3.5. The differences among the models were not 
      statistically significant. All LLMs demonstrated significantly lower accuracy for 
      dentistry questions compared to other types of questions (p&lt;0.01). Conclusions 
      GPT-4 achieved the highest overall score in the JNDE, followed by Bard and 
      GPT-3.5. However, only Bard surpassed the passing score for essential questions. 
      To further understand the application of LLMs in clinical dentistry worldwide, 
      more research on their performance in dental examinations across different 
      languages is required.

TI  - ChatGPT Research Group for Optimizing the Crystallinity of MOFs and COFs.
PG  - 2161-2170
LID - 10.1021/acscentsci.3c01087 [doi]
AB  - We leveraged the power of ChatGPT and Bayesian optimization in the development of 
      a multi-AI-driven system, backed by seven large language model-based assistants 
      and equipped with machine learning algorithms, that seamlessly orchestrates a 
      multitude of research aspects in a chemistry laboratory (termed the ChatGPT 
      Research Group). Our approach accelerated the discovery of optimal microwave 
      synthesis conditions, enhancing the crystallinity of MOF-321, MOF-322, and 
      COF-323 and achieving the desired porosity and water capacity. In this system, 
      human researchers gained assistance from these diverse AI collaborators, each 
      with a unique role within the laboratory environment, spanning strategy planning, 
      literature search, coding, robotic operation, labware design, safety inspection, 
      and data analysis. Such a comprehensive approach enables a single researcher 
      working in concert with AI to achieve productivity levels analogous to those of 
      an entire traditional scientific team. Furthermore, by reducing human biases in 
      screening experimental conditions and deftly balancing the exploration and 
      exploitation of synthesis parameters, our Bayesian search approach precisely 
      zeroed in on optimal synthesis conditions from a pool of 6 million within a 
      significantly shortened time scale. This work serves as a compelling proof of 
      concept for an AI-driven revolution in the chemistry laboratory, painting a 
      future where AI becomes an efficient collaborator, liberating us from routine 
      tasks to focus on pushing the boundaries of innovation.

TI  - Are ChatGPT's Free-Text Responses on Periprosthetic Joint Infections of the Hip 
      and Knee Reliable and Useful?
LID - 10.3390/jcm12206655 [doi]
LID - 6655
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate ChatGPT's performance on questions about 
      periprosthetic joint infections (PJI) of the hip and knee. METHODS: Twenty-seven 
      questions from the 2018 International Consensus Meeting on Musculoskeletal 
      Infection were selected for response generation. The free-text responses were 
      evaluated by three orthopedic surgeons using a five-point Likert scale. 
      Inter-rater reliability (IRR) was assessed via Fleiss' kappa (FK). RESULTS: 
      Overall, near-perfect IRR was found for disagreement on the presence of factual 
      errors (FK: 0.880, 95% CI [0.724, 1.035], p &lt; 0.001) and agreement on information 
      completeness (FK: 0.848, 95% CI [0.699, 0.996], p &lt; 0.001). Substantial IRR was 
      observed for disagreement on misleading information (FK: 0.743, 95% CI [0.601, 
      0.886], p &lt; 0.001) and agreement on suitability for patients (FK: 0.627, 95% CI 
      [0.478, 0.776], p &lt; 0.001). Moderate IRR was observed for agreement on 
      "up-to-dateness" (FK: 0.584, 95% CI [0.434, 0.734], p &lt; 0.001) and suitability 
      for orthopedic surgeons (FK: 0.505, 95% CI [0.383, 0.628], p &lt; 0.001). Question- 
      and subtopic-specific analysis revealed diverse IRR levels ranging from 
      near-perfect to poor. CONCLUSIONS: ChatGPT's free-text responses to complex 
      orthopedic questions were predominantly reliable and useful for orthopedic 
      surgeons and patients. Given variations in performance by question and subtopic, 
      consulting additional sources and exercising careful interpretation should be 
      emphasized for reliable medical decision-making.

AB  - AI Chat Bots such as ChatGPT are revolutionizing our AI capabilities, especially 
      in text generation, to help expedite many tasks, but they introduce new dilemmas. 
      The detection of AI-generated text has become a subject of great debate 
      considering the AI text detector's known and unexpected limitations. Thus far, 
      much research in this area has focused on the detection of AI-generated text; 
      however, the goal of this study was to evaluate the opposite scenario, an AI-text 
      detection tool's ability to discriminate human-generated text. Thousands of 
      abstracts from several of the most well-known scientific journals were used to 
      test the predictive capabilities of these detection tools, assessing abstracts 
      from 1980 to 2023. We found that the AI text detector erroneously identified up 
      to 8% of the known real abstracts as AI-generated text. This further highlights 
      the current limitations of such detection tools and argues for novel detectors or 
      combined approaches that can address this shortcoming and minimize its 
      unanticipated consequences as we navigate this new AI landscape.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: People with epilepsy desire to acquire accurate information about 
      epilepsy and actively engage in its management throughout the long journey of 
      living with seizures. ChatGPT is a large language model and we aimed to assess 
      the accuracy and consistency of ChatGPT in responding to the common concerns of 
      people with epilepsy and to evaluate its ability to provide emotional support. 
      METHODS: Questions were collected from the International League against Epilepsy 
      and the China Association against Epilepsy. The responses were independently 
      assessed by two board-certified epileptologists from the China Association 
      against Epilepsy, and a third reviewer resolved disagreements. The reviewers 
      assessed its ability to provide emotional support subjectively. RESULTS: A total 
      of 378 questions related to epilepsy and 5 questions related to emotional support 
      were included. ChatGPT provided "correct and comprehensive" answers to 68.4% of 
      the questions. The model provided reproducible answers for 82.3% questions. The 
      model performed poorly in answering prognostic questions, with only 46.8% of the 
      answers rated as comprehensive. When faced with questions requiring emotional 
      support, the model can generate natural and understandable responses. 
      SIGNIFICANCE: ChatGPT provides accurate and reliable answers to patients with 
      epilepsy and is a valuable source of information. It also provides partial 
      emotional support, potentially assisting those experiencing emotional distress. 
      However, ChatGPT may provide incorrect responses, leading users to inadvertently 
      accept incorrect and potentially dangerous advice. Therefore, the direct use of 
      ChatGPT for medical guidance is not recommended and its primary use at present is 
      in patients education.

PG  - 231393
LID - 10.1098/rsos.231393 [doi]
LID - 231393
AB  - As large language models (LLMs) have become more deeply integrated into various 
      sectors, understanding how they make moral judgements has become crucial, 
      particularly in the realm of autonomous driving. This study used the moral 
      machine framework to investigate the ethical decision-making tendencies of 
      prominent LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, PaLM 2 and Llama 2, to compare their 
      responses with human preferences. While LLMs' and humans' preferences such as 
      prioritizing humans over pets and favouring saving more lives are broadly 
      aligned, PaLM 2 and Llama 2, especially, evidence distinct deviations. 
      Additionally, despite the qualitative similarities between the LLM and human 
      preferences, there are significant quantitative disparities, suggesting that LLMs 
      might lean toward more uncompromising decisions, compared with the milder 
      inclinations of humans. These insights elucidate the ethical frameworks of LLMs 
      and their potential implications for autonomous driving.

AB  - This editorial discusses the potential benefits of integrating large language 
      models (LLMs), such as&nbsp;GPT-4, into electronic health records (EHRs) to optimize 
      patient care, improve clinical decision-making, and promote efficient healthcare 
      management. Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven LLMs can revolutionize healthcare 
      practices by streamlining the data input process, expediting information 
      extraction from unstructured narratives, and facilitating personalized patient 
      communication. However, concerns related to patient privacy, data security, and 
      potential biases must be addressed to ensure equitable healthcare for all. 
      Therefore, we encourage healthcare professionals and researchers to explore 
      innovative solutions that leverage AI capabilities while addressing the 
      challenges associated with privacy and equity.

AB  - Successful full-mouth rehabilitation requires contemporary and advanced treatment 
      planning, especially in distal extension cases. Multiple treatment modalities are 
      available in those cases. Treatment outcome in these patients remains 
      challenging. Though implants are one of the treatment options in such scenarios, 
      fixed removable partial dentures with precision attachments are the best 
      treatment options for patients who cannot afford expensive treatment. We have 
      made an attempt to describe a case report of a long-span edentulous arch by 
      incorporating the ideas and information received from Chat Generative Pre-trained 
      Transformer (GPT).

TI  - Using AI to Write a Review Article Examining the Role of the Nervous System on 
      Skeletal Homeostasis and Fracture Healing.
PG  - 217-221
LID - 10.1007/s11914-023-00854-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Three review articles have been written that discuss the roles 
      of the central and peripheral nervous systems in fracture healing. While content 
      among the articles is overlapping, there is a key difference between them: the 
      use of artificial intelligence (AI). In one paper, the first draft was written 
      solely by humans. In the second paper, the first draft was written solely by AI 
      using ChatGPT 4.0 (AI-only or AIO). In the third paper, the first draft was 
      written using ChatGPT 4.0 but the literature references were supplied from the 
      human-written paper (AI-assisted or AIA). This project was done to evaluate the 
      capacity of AI to conduct scientific writing. Importantly, all manuscripts were 
      fact checked and extensively edited by all co-authors rendering the final 
      manuscript drafts significantly different from the first drafts. RECENT FINDINGS: 
      Unsurprisingly, the use of AI decreased the time spent to write a review. The two 
      AI-written reviews took less time to write than the human-written paper; however, 
      the changes and editing required in all three manuscripts were extensive. The 
      human-written paper was edited the most. On the other hand, the AI-only paper was 
      the most inaccurate with inappropriate reference usage and the AI-assisted paper 
      had the greatest incidence of plagiarism. These findings show that each style of 
      writing presents its own unique set of challenges and advantages. While AI can 
      theoretically write scientific reviews, from these findings, the extent of 
      editing done subsequently, the inaccuracy of the claims it makes, and the 
      plagiarism by AI are all factors to be considered and a primary reason why it may 
      be several years into the future before AI can present itself as a viable 
      alternative for traditional scientific writing.

TI  - Improving the use of LLMs in radiology through prompt engineering: from precision 
      prompts to zero-shot learning.
LID - 10.1055/a-2264-5631 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE:  Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have shown significant 
      potential in radiology. Their effectiveness often depends on prompt engineering, 
      which optimizes the interaction with the chatbot for accurate results. Here, we 
      highlight the critical role of prompt engineering in tailoring the LLMs' 
      responses to specific medical tasks. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Using a clinical 
      case, we elucidate different prompting strategies to adapt the LLM ChatGPT using 
      GPT4 to new tasks without additional training of the base model. These approaches 
      range from precision prompts to advanced in-context methods such as few-shot and 
      zero-shot learning. Additionally, the significance of embeddings, which serve as 
      a data representation technique, is discussed. RESULTS:  Prompt engineering 
      substantially improved and focused the chatbot's output. Moreover, embedding of 
      specialized knowledge allows for more transparent insight into the model's 
      decision-making and thus enhances trust. CONCLUSION:  Despite certain challenges, 
      prompt engineering plays a pivotal role in harnessing the potential of LLMs for 
      specialized tasks in the medical domain, particularly radiology. As LLMs continue 
      to evolve, techniques like few-shot learning, zero-shot learning, and 
      embedding-based retrieval mechanisms will become indispensable in delivering 
      tailored outputs. KEY POINTS:   · Large language models might impact radiological 
      practice and decision-masking.. · However, implementation and performance are 
      dependent on the assigned task.. · Optimization of prompting strategies can 
      substantially improve model performance.. · Strategies for prompt engineering 
      range from precision prompts to zero-shot learning..

TI  - GenePT: A Simple But Effective Foundation Model for Genes and Cells Built From 
      ChatGPT.
LID - 2023.10.16.562533 [pii]
LID - 10.1101/2023.10.16.562533 [doi]
AB  - There has been significant recent progress in leveraging large-scale gene 
      expression data to develop foundation models for single-cell biology. Models such 
      as Geneformer and scGPT implicitly learn gene and cellular functions from the 
      gene expression profiles of millions of cells, which requires extensive data 
      curation and resource-intensive training. Here we explore a much simpler 
      alternative by leveraging ChatGPT embeddings of genes based on literature. Our 
      proposal, GenePT, uses NCBI text descriptions of individual genes with GPT-3.5 to 
      generate gene embeddings. From there, GenePT generates single-cell embeddings in 
      two ways: (i) by averaging the gene embeddings, weighted by each gene's 
      expression level; or (ii) by creating a sentence embedding for each cell, using 
      gene names ordered by the expression level. Without the need for dataset curation 
      and additional pretraining, GenePT is efficient and easy to use. On many 
      downstream tasks used to evaluate recent single-cell foundation models - e.g., 
      classifying gene properties and cell types - GenePT achieves comparable, and 
      often better, performance than Geneformer and other models. GenePT demonstrates 
      that large language model embedding of literature is a simple and effective path 
      for biological foundation models.

TI  - A chat about bipolar disorder.
LID - 10.1111/bdi.13379 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the capabilities of ChatGPT (Chat 
      Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) in generating informative content related to 
      bipolar disorders. The objectives were to evaluate its ability to provide 
      accurate information on symptoms, classification, causes, and management of 
      bipolar disorder and to explore its creativity in generating topic-related songs. 
      METHODS: ChatGPT3 was used for the study, and a series of clinically relevant 
      questions were asked to test its knowledge and creativity. Questions ranged from 
      common symptom descriptions to more artistic requests for songs related to 
      bipolar disorder. RESULTS: ChatGPT demonstrated the capacity to provide basic and 
      informative material on bipolar disorders, including descriptions of symptoms, 
      classification types, causes, and treatment options. It also showed creativity in 
      generating songs that capture the nuances of bipolar symptoms, both during high 
      and low states. CONCLUSIONS: While ChatGPT3 can offer superficial information on 
      psychiatric topics like bipolar disorder, its inability to provide accurate and 
      up-to-date references limits its utility for creating a comprehensive review 
      article for scientific journals. However, it may be helpful in generating 
      educational material and assisting in component tasks for those with bipolar 
      disorder or other psychiatric conditions. As newer versions of AI models are 
      continually developed, their capabilities in producing more accurate and advanced 
      content will need further evaluation.

      Quantitative Bibliometric Analysis.

AB  - The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technology in recent years 
      have led to its integration into biomedical publishing. However, the extent to 
      which AI has contributed to developing biomedical literature is unclear. This 
      study aimed to identify trends in AI-generated content within peer-reviewed 
      biomedical literature. We first tested the sensitivity and specificity of 
      commercially available AI-detection software (Originality.AI, Collingwood, 
      Ontario, Canada). Next, we conducted a MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and 
      Retrieval System Online) search to identify randomized controlled trials with 
      available abstracts indexed between January 2020 and March 2023. We randomly 
      selected 30 abstracts per quarter during this period and pasted the abstracts 
      into the AI detection software to determine the probability of AI-generated 
      content. The software yielded 100% sensitivity, 95% specificity, and excellent 
      overall discriminatory ability with an area under the receiving operating curve 
      of 97.6%. Among the 390 MEDLINE-indexed abstracts included in the analysis, the 
      prevalence with a high probability (≥ 90%) of AI-generated text increased during 
      the study period from 21.7% to 36.7% (p=0.01) based on a chi-square test for 
      trend. The increasing prevalence of AI-generated text during the study period was 
      also observed in various sensitivity analyses using AI probability thresholds 
      ranging from 50% to 99% (all p≤0.01). The results of this study suggest that the 
      prevalence of AI-assisted publishing in peer-reviewed journals has been 
      increasing in recent years, even before the widespread adoption of ChatGPT 
      (OpenAI, San Francisco, California, United States) and similar tools. The extent 
      to which natural writing characteristics of the authors, utilization of common 
      AI-powered applications, and introduction of AI elements during the 
      post-acceptance publication phase influence AI detection scores warrants further 
      study.

TI  - Responses of Five Different Artificial Intelligence Chatbots to the Top Searched 
      Queries About Erectile Dysfunction: A Comparative Analysis.

AB  - The aim of the study is&nbsp;to evaluate and compare the quality and readability of 
      responses generated by five different artificial intelligence (AI) 
      chatbots-ChatGPT, Bard, Bing, Ernie, and Copilot-to the top searched queries of 
      erectile dysfunction (ED). Google Trends was used to identify ED-related relevant 
      phrases. Each AI chatbot received a specific sequence of 25 frequently searched 
      terms as input. Responses were evaluated using DISCERN, Ensuring Quality 
      Information for Patients (EQIP), and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL) and 
      Reading Ease (FKRE) metrics. The top three most frequently searched phrases were 
      "erectile dysfunction cause", "how to erectile dysfunction," and "erectile 
      dysfunction treatment." Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Ghana exhibited the highest level 
      of interest in ED. None of the AI chatbots achieved the necessary degree of 
      readability. However, Bard exhibited significantly higher FKRE and FKGL ratings 
      (p = 0.001), and Copilot achieved better EQIP and DISCERN ratings than the other 
      chatbots (p = 0.001). Bard exhibited the simplest linguistic framework and posed 
      the least challenge in terms of readability and comprehension, and Copilot's text 
      quality on ED was superior to the other chatbots. As new chatbots are introduced, 
      their understandability and text quality increase, providing better guidance to 
      patients.

      high-quality text responses to instructions and questions without the need for 
      labor-intensive task-specific training data or complex software engineering. As 
      the technology continues to mature, LLMs hold immense potential for transforming 
      clinical workflows, enhancing patient outcomes, improving medical education, and 
      optimizing medical research. In this review, we provide a practical discussion of 
      LLMs, tailored to gastroenterologists. We highlight the technical foundations of 
      LLMs, emphasizing their key strengths and limitations as well as how to interact 
      with them safely and effectively. We discuss some potential LLM use cases for 
      clinical gastroenterology practice, education, and research. Finally, we review 
      critical barriers to implementation and ongoing work to address these issues. 
      This review aims to equip gastroenterologists with a foundational understanding 
      of LLMs to facilitate a more active clinician role in the development and 
      implementation of this rapidly emerging technology.

AB  - In this paper, we experimentally evaluate the zero-shot performance of GPT-4 
      against prior generations of GPT on the entire uniform bar examination (UBE), 
      including not only the multiple-choice multistate bar examination (MBE), but also 
      the open-ended multistate essay exam (MEE) and multistate performance test (MPT) 
      components. On the MBE, GPT-4 significantly outperforms both human test-takers 
      and prior models, demonstrating a 26% increase over ChatGPT and beating humans in 
      five of seven subject areas. On the MEE and MPT, which have not previously been 
      evaluated by scholars, GPT-4 scores an average of 4.2/6.0 when compared with much 
      lower scores for ChatGPT. Graded across the UBE components, in the manner in 
      which a human test-taker would be, GPT-4 scores approximately 297 points, 
      significantly in excess of the passing threshold for all UBE jurisdictions. These 
      findings document not just the rapid and remarkable advance of large language 
      model performance generally, but also the potential for such models to support 
      the delivery of legal services in society. This article is part of the theme 
      issue 'A complexity science approach to law and governance'.

AB  - PURPOSE: To discuss the implications of large language models (LLMs) in 
      ophthalmology research, as well as the associated ethical considerations. DESIGN: 
      Perspective. METHODS: This discussion reviews the potential uses of LLMs such as 
      ChatGPT in ophthalmology research, highlights the associated threats and ethical 
      considerations, and proposes solutions for the use of LLMs in ophthalmology 
      research and scientific writing. RESULTS: With the increasing interest in LLMs, 
      such as ChatGPT, their diverse utility has been widely explored, including their 
      application in research and scientific writing. LLMs have the potential to guide 
      researchers throughout the different stages of their research, from idea 
      generation to drafting a scientific piece. However, there are significant ethical 
      concerns and challenges related to scientific integrity in ophthalmology research 
      that should be addressed by scientific journals. Our review of the 10 
      highest-impact-factor ophthalmology journals revealed that the number of journals 
      addressing this topic in their submission guidelines is rapidly increasing. 
      Therefore, we propose certain domains that all journals should consider regarding 
      the use of LLMs in research. CONCLUSIONS: As LLMs continue to improve, their use 
      in scientific writing will remain a contentious issue due to the ethical dilemmas 
      involved in determining the appropriate scope of their use. This article reviews 
      the ethical dilemmas related to the use of LLMs in ophthalmology research and 
      calls for the prompt development of guidelines for their ethical use in 
      manuscript writing as ophthalmology journals update their editorial policies with 
      respect to LLMs.

AB  - As large language models (LLMs) expand and become more advanced, so do the 
      natural language processing capabilities of conversational AI, or "chatbots". 
      OpenAI's recent release, ChatGPT, uses a transformer-based model to enable 
      human-like text generation and question-answering on general domain knowledge, 
      while a healthcare-specific Large Language Model (LLM) such as GatorTron has 
      focused on the real-world healthcare domain knowledge. As LLMs advance to achieve 
      near human-level performances on medical question and answering benchmarks, it is 
      probable that Conversational AI will soon be developed for use in healthcare. In 
      this article we discuss the potential and compare the performance of two 
      different approaches to generative pretrained transformers-ChatGPT, the most 
      widely used general conversational LLM, and Foresight, a GPT (generative 
      pretrained transformer) based model focused on modelling patients and disorders. 
      The comparison is conducted on the task of forecasting relevant diagnoses based 
      on clinical vignettes. We also discuss important considerations and limitations 
      of transformer-based chatbots for clinical use.

TI  - Opportunities and Considerations for the Incorporation of Artificial Intelligence 
      into Global Neurosurgery: A Generative Pre-Trained Transformer Chatbot-Based 
      Approach.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Global neurosurgery is a public health focus in neurosurgery that 
      seeks to ensure safe, timely, and affordable neurosurgical care to all 
      individuals worldwide. Although investigators have begun to explore the promise 
      of AI for neurosurgery, its applicability to global neurosurgery has been largely 
      hypothetical. We characterize opportunities and considerations for the 
      incorporation of AI into global neurosurgery by synthesizing key themes yielded 
      from a series of generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs), discuss important 
      limitations of GPTs and cautions when using AI in neurosurgery, and develop a 
      framework for the equitable incorporation of AI into global neurosurgery. 
      METHODS: ChatGPT, Bing Chat / Copilot, You, Perplexity.ai, and Google Bard were 
      queried with the prompt "How can artificial intelligence be incorporated into 
      global neurosurgery?". A layered ChatGPT-based thematic analysis was performed. 
      The authors synthesized the results into opportunities and considerations for the 
      incorporation of AI in global neurosurgery. A Pareto analysis was conducted to 
      determine common themes. RESULTS: Eight opportunities and fourteen important 
      considerations were synthesized. Six opportunities related to patient care, one 
      to education, and another to public health planning. Four of the important 
      considerations were deemed specific to global neurosurgery. The Pareto analysis 
      included all eight opportunities and five considerations. CONCLUSION: AI may be 
      incorporated into global neurosurgery in a variety of capacities requiring 
      numerous considerations. The framework presented in this manuscript may 
      facilitate the incorporation of AI into global neurosurgery initiatives while 
      balancing contextual factors and the reality of limited resources.

TI  - Performance of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Powered Chatbots in the Assessment of 
      Medical Case Reports: Qualitative Insights From Simulated Scenarios.
PG  - e53899
LID - 10.7759/cureus.53899 [doi]
LID - e53899
AB  - Introduction With the expanding awareness and use of AI-powered chatbots, it 
      seems possible that an increasing number of people could use them to assess and 
      evaluate their medical symptoms. If chatbots are used for this purpose, that have 
      not previously undergone a thorough medical evaluation for this specific use, 
      various risks might arise. The aim of this study is to analyze and compare the 
      performance of popular chatbots in differentiating between severe and less 
      critical medical symptoms described from a patient's perspective and to 
      examine&nbsp;the variations in substantive medical assessment accuracy and empathetic 
      communication style among the chatbots' responses. Materials and methods Our 
      study compared three different AI-supported chatbots - OpenAI's ChatGPT 3.5, 
      Microsoft's Bing Chat, and Inflection's Pi AI. Three exemplary case reports for 
      medical emergencies as well as three cases without an urgent reason for an 
      emergency medical admission were constructed and analyzed. Each case report was 
      accompanied by identical questions concerning the most likely suspected diagnosis 
      and the urgency of an immediate medical evaluation. The respective answers of the 
      chatbots were qualitatively compared with each other regarding the medical 
      accuracy of the differential diagnoses mentioned and the conclusions drawn, as 
      well as regarding patient-oriented and empathetic language. Results All examined 
      chatbots were capable of providing medically plausible and probable diagnoses and 
      classifying situations as acute or less critical. However, their responses varied 
      slightly in the level of their urgency assessment. Clear differences could be 
      seen in the level of detail of the differential diagnoses, the overall length of 
      the answers, and how the chatbot dealt with the challenge of being confronted 
      with medical issues. All given answers were comparable in terms of empathy level 
      and comprehensibility. Conclusion Even AI chatbots that are not designed for 
      medical applications already offer substantial guidance in assessing typical 
      medical emergency indications but should always be provided with a disclaimer. In 
      responding to medical queries, characteristic differences emerge among chatbots 
      in the extent and style of their respective answers. Given the lack of medical 
      supervision of many established chatbots, subsequent studies, and experiences are 
      essential to clarify whether a more extensive use of these chatbots for medical 
      concerns will have a positive impact on healthcare or rather pose major medical 
      risks.

PG  - e43262
LID - 10.7759/cureus.43262 [doi]
LID - e43262
AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare promises 
      groundbreaking advancements in patient care, revolutionizing clinical diagnosis, 
      predictive medicine, and decision-making. This transformative technology uses 
      machine learning, natural language processing, and large language models (LLMs) 
      to process and reason like human intelligence. OpenAI's ChatGPT, a sophisticated 
      LLM, holds immense potential in medical practice, research, and education. 
      However, as AI in healthcare gains momentum, it brings forth profound ethical 
      challenges that demand careful consideration. This comprehensive review explores 
      key ethical concerns in the domain, including privacy, transparency, trust, 
      responsibility, bias, and data quality. Protecting patient privacy in data-driven 
      healthcare is crucial, with potential implications for psychological well-being 
      and data sharing. Strategies like homomorphic encryption (HE) and secure 
      multiparty computation (SMPC) are vital to preserving confidentiality. 
      Transparency and trustworthiness of AI systems are essential, particularly in 
      high-risk decision-making scenarios. Explainable AI (XAI) emerges as a critical 
      aspect, ensuring a clear understanding of AI-generated predictions. Cybersecurity 
      becomes a pressing concern as AI's complexity creates vulnerabilities for 
      potential breaches. Determining responsibility in AI-driven outcomes raises 
      important questions, with debates on AI's moral agency and human accountability. 
      Shifting from data ownership to data stewardship enables responsible data 
      management in compliance with regulations. Addressing bias in healthcare data is 
      crucial to avoid AI-driven inequities. Biases present in data collection and 
      algorithm development can perpetuate healthcare disparities. A public-health 
      approach is advocated to address inequalities and promote diversity in AI 
      research and the workforce. Maintaining data quality is imperative in AI 
      applications, with convolutional neural networks showing promise in 
      multi-input/mixed data models, offering a comprehensive patient perspective. In 
      this ever-evolving landscape, it is imperative to adopt a multidimensional 
      approach involving policymakers, developers, healthcare practitioners, and 
      patients to mitigate ethical concerns. By understanding and addressing these 
      challenges, we can harness the full potential of AI in healthcare while ensuring 
      ethical and equitable outcomes.

TI  - Leveraging GPT-4 for food effect summarization to enhance product-specific 
      guidance development via iterative prompting.

AB  - Food effect summarization from New Drug Application (NDA) is an essential 
      component of product-specific guidance (PSG) development and assessment, which 
      provides the basis of recommendations for fasting and fed bioequivalence studies 
      to guide the pharmaceutical industry for developing generic drug products. 
      However, manual summarization of food effect from extensive drug application 
      review documents is time-consuming. Therefore, there is a need to develop 
      automated methods to generate food effect summary. Recent advances in natural 
      language processing (NLP), particularly large language models (LLMs) such as 
      ChatGPT and GPT-4, have demonstrated great potential in improving the 
      effectiveness of automated text summarization, but its ability with regard to the 
      accuracy in summarizing food effect for PSG assessment remains unclear. In this 
      study, we introduce a simple yet effective approach,iterative prompting, which 
      allows one to interact with ChatGPT or GPT-4 more effectively and efficiently 
      through multi-turn interaction. Specifically, we propose a three-turn iterative 
      prompting approach to food effect summarization in which the keyword-focused and 
      length-controlled prompts are respectively provided in consecutive turns to 
      refine the quality of the generated summary. We conduct a series of extensive 
      evaluations, ranging from automated metrics to FDA professionals and even 
      evaluation by GPT-4, on 100 NDA review documents selected over the past five 
      years. We observe that the summary quality is progressively improved throughout 
      the iterative prompting process. Moreover, we find that GPT-4 performs better 
      than ChatGPT, as evaluated by FDA professionals (43% vs. 12%) and GPT-4 (64% vs. 
      35%). Importantly, all the FDA professionals unanimously rated that 85% of the 
      summaries generated by GPT-4 are factually consistent with the golden reference 
      summary, a finding further supported by GPT-4 rating of 72% consistency. Taken 
      together, these results strongly suggest a great potential for GPT-4 to draft 
      food effect summaries that could be reviewed by FDA professionals, thereby 
      improving the efficiency of the PSG assessment cycle and promoting generic drug 
      product development.

AB  - The authors present the case of a middle-aged lady with two weeks of abdominal 
      pain. Computed tomography imaging revealed sclerosing mesenteritis. Sclerosing 
      mesenteritis is also known as mesenteric panniculitis and is a chronic fibrosing 
      inflammatory disease that primarily affects the adipose tissue of the mesentery 
      in the small intestine and colon.&nbsp;The clinical presentation, imaging findings, 
      differential diagnosis, and therapeutic management are presented in this report. 
      In our patient's case, she was able to be managed conservatively, without the 
      need for surgery. This reflects the most benign and self-limiting natural history 
      of the disease.

TI  - Sentiment Analysis: Comprehensive Reviews, Recent Advances, and Open Challenges.
LID - 10.1109/TNNLS.2023.3294810 [doi]
AB  - Sentiment analysis (SA) aims to understand the attitudes and views of opinion 
      holders with computers. Previous studies have achieved significant breakthroughs 
      and extensive applications in the past decade, such as public opinion analysis 
      and intelligent voice service. With the rapid development of deep learning, SA 
      based on various modalities has become a research hotspot. However, only 
      individual modality has been analyzed separately, lacking a systematic carding of 
      comprehensive SA methods. Meanwhile, few surveys covering the topic of multimodal 
      SA (MSA) have been explored yet. In this article, we first take the modality as 
      the thread to design a novel framework of SA tasks to provide researchers with a 
      comprehensive understanding of relevant advances in SA. Then, we introduce the 
      general workflows and recent advances of single-modal in detail, discuss the 
      similarities and differences of single-modal SA in data processing and modeling 
      to guide MSA, and summarize the commonly used datasets to provide guidance on 
      data and methods for researchers according to different task types. Next, a new 
      taxonomy is proposed to fill the research gaps in MSA, which is divided into 
      multimodal representation learning and multimodal data fusion. The similarities 
      and differences between these two methods and the latest advances are described 
      in detail, such as dynamic interaction between multimodalities, and the 
      multimodal fusion technologies are further expanded. Moreover, we explore the 
      advanced studies on multimodal alignment, chatbots, and Chat Generative 
      Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) in SA. Finally, we discuss the open research 
      challenges of MSA and provide four potential aspects to improve future works, 
      such as cross-modal contrastive learning and multimodal pretraining models.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform healthcare, but its 
      clinical use also has important challenges and limitations. Recently natural 
      language processing and generative pre-training transformer (GPT) models have 
      gained particular interest due to their ability to simulate human conversation. 
      We aimed to explore output of the ChatGPT model (OpenAI, 
      https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) regarding current debates in cardiovascular CT. 
      Prompts included debate questions from the Society of Cardiovascular Computed 
      Tomography 2023 programme as well as questions about high risk plaque (HRP), 
      quantitative plaque analysis, and how AI will transform cardiovascular CT. The AI 
      model rapidly provided plausible responses including both pro and con sides of 
      the argument. Advantages of AI for cardiovascular CT that were described by the 
      AI model included improving image quality, speed of reporting, accuracy, and 
      consistency. The AI model also acknowledged the importance for continued 
      involvement of clinicians in patient care.

AB  - Personalized healthcare management is an emerging field that requires the 
      development of environment-friendly, integrated, and electrochemical multimodal 
      devices. In this study, the concept of integrated paper-based biosensors 
      (IFP(-Multi) ) for personalized healthcare management is introduced. By 
      leveraging ink printing technology and a ChatGPT-bioelectronic interface, these 
      biosensors offer ultrahigh areal-specific capacitance (74633 mF cm(-2) ), 
      excellent mechanical properties, and multifunctional sensing and humidity power 
      generation capabilities. More&nbsp;importantly, the IFP(-Multi) devices have the 
      potential to simulate deaf-mute vocalization and can be integrated into wearable 
      sensors to detect muscle contractions and bending motions. Moreover, they also 
      enable monitoring of physiological signals from various body parts, such as the 
      throat, nape, elbow, wrist, and knee, and successfully record sharp and 
      repeatable signals generated by muscle contractions. In addition, the IFP(-Multi) 
      devices demonstrate self-powered handwriting sensing and moisture power 
      generation for sweat-sensing applications. As a proof-of-concept, a GPT 3.5 
      model-based fine-tuning and prediction pipeline that utilizes recorded 
      physiological signals through IFP(-Multi) is showcased, enabling artificial 
      intelligence with multimodal sensing capabilities for personalized healthcare 
      management. This work presents a promising and ecofriendly approach to developing 
      paper-based electrochemical multimodal devices, paving the way for a new era of 
      healthcare advancements.

TI  - Assessing the research landscape and clinical utility of large language models: a 
      scoping review.
PG  - 72
LID - 10.1186/s12911-024-02459-6 [doi]
LID - 72
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's ChatGPT are powerful 
      generative systems that rapidly synthesize natural language responses. Research 
      on LLMs has revealed their potential and pitfalls, especially in clinical 
      settings. However, the evolving landscape of LLM research in medicine has left 
      several gaps regarding their evaluation, application, and evidence base. 
      OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to (1) summarize current research evidence on 
      the accuracy and efficacy of LLMs in medical applications, (2) discuss the 
      ethical, legal, logistical, and socioeconomic implications of LLM use in clinical 
      settings, (3) explore barriers and facilitators to LLM implementation in 
      healthcare, (4) propose a standardized evaluation framework for assessing LLMs' 
      clinical utility, and (5) identify evidence gaps and propose future research 
      directions for LLMs in clinical applications. EVIDENCE REVIEW: We screened 4,036 
      records from MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, medRxiv, bioRxiv, and arXiv from January 
      2023 (inception of the search) to June 26, 2023 for English-language papers and 
      analyzed findings from 55 worldwide studies. Quality of evidence was reported 
      based on the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine recommendations. FINDINGS: 
      Our results demonstrate that LLMs show promise in compiling patient notes, 
      assisting patients in navigating the healthcare system, and to some extent, 
      supporting clinical decision-making when combined with human oversight. However, 
      their utilization is limited by biases in training data that may harm patients, 
      the generation of inaccurate but convincing information, and ethical, legal, 
      socioeconomic, and privacy concerns. We also identified a lack of standardized 
      methods for evaluating LLMs' effectiveness and feasibility. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: This review thus highlights potential future directions and questions 
      to address these limitations and to further explore LLMs' potential in enhancing 
      healthcare delivery.

AB  - There is extensive literature emerging in the field of dentistry with the aim to 
      optimize clinical practice. Evidence-based guidelines (EBGs) are designed to 
      collate diagnostic criteria and clinical treatment for a range of conditions 
      based on high-quality evidence. Recently, advancements in Artificial Intelligence 
      (AI) have instigated further queries into its applicability and integration into 
      dentistry. Hence, the aim of this study was to develop a model that can be used 
      to assess the accuracy of treatment recommendations for dental conditions 
      generated by individual clinicians and the outcomes of AI outputs. For this pilot 
      study, a Delphi panel of six experts led by CoTreat AI provided the definition 
      and developed evidence-based recommendations for subgingival and supragingival 
      calculus. For the rapid review-a pragmatic approach that aims to rapidly assess 
      the evidence base using a systematic methodology-the Ovid Medline database was 
      searched for subgingival and supragingival calculus. Studies were selected and 
      reported based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
      Meta-analyses (PRISMA), and this study complied with the minimum requirements for 
      completing a restricted systematic review. Treatment recommendations were also 
      searched for these same conditions in ChatGPT (version 3.5 and 4) and Bard (now 
      Gemini). Adherence to the recommendations of the standard was assessed using 
      qualitative content analysis and agreement scores for interrater reliability. 
      Treatment recommendations by AI programs generally aligned with the current 
      literature, with an agreement of up to 75%, although data sources were not 
      provided by these tools, except for Bard. The clinician's rapid review results 
      suggested several procedures that may increase the likelihood of overtreatment, 
      as did GPT4. In terms of overall accuracy, GPT4 outperformed all other tools, 
      including rapid review (Cohen's kappa 0.42 vs. 0.28). In summary, this study 
      provides preliminary observations for the suitability of different 
      evidence-generating methods to inform clinical dental practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence 
      Read Archive (SRA) has amassed a vast reservoir of genetic data since its 
      inception in 2007. These public data hold immense potential for supporting 
      pathogen surveillance and control. However, the lack of standardized metadata and 
      inconsistent submission practices in SRA may impede the data's utility in public 
      health. METHODS: To address this issue, we introduce the Search-based Geographic 
      Metadata Curation (SGMC) pipeline. SGMC utilized Python and web scraping to 
      extract geographic data of sequencing institutions from NCBI SRA in the Cloud and 
      its website. It then harnessed ChatGPT to refine the sequencing institution and 
      location assignments. To illustrate the pipeline's utility, we examined the 
      geographic distribution of the sequencing institutions and their countries 
      relevant to polio eradication and categorized them. RESULTS: SGMC successfully 
      identified 7,649 sequencing institutions and their global locations from a random 
      selection of 2,321,044 SRA accessions. These institutions were distributed across 
      97 countries, with strong representation in the United States, the United Kingdom 
      and China. However, there was a lack of data from African, Central Asian, and 
      Central American countries, indicating potential disparities in sequencing 
      capabilities. Comparison with manually curated data for U.S. institutions reveals 
      SGMC's accuracy rates of 94.8% for institutions, 93.1% for countries, and 74.5% 
      for geographic coordinates. CONCLUSION: SGMC may represent a novel approach using 
      a generative AI model to enhance geographic data (country and institution 
      assignments) for large numbers of samples within SRA datasets. This information 
      can be utilized to bolster public health endeavors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The recent introduction of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)-4 
      has demonstrated the potential to be a superior version of ChatGPT-3.5. According 
      to many, GPT-4 is seen as a more reliable and creative version of GPT-3.5. 
      OBJECTIVE: In conjugation with our prior manuscript, we wanted to determine if 
      GPT-4 could be exploited as an instrument for plastic surgery graduate medical 
      education by evaluating its performance on the Plastic Surgery Inservice Training 
      Examination (PSITE). METHODS: Sample assessment questions from the 2022 PSITE 
      were obtained from the American Council of Academic Plastic Surgeons website and 
      manually inputted into GPT-4. Responses by GPT-4 were qualified using the 
      properties of natural coherence. Incorrect answers were stratified into the 
      consequent categories: informational, logical, or explicit fallacy. RESULTS: From 
      a total of 242 questions, GPT-4 provided correct answers for 187, resulting in a 
      77.3% accuracy rate. Logical reasoning was utilized in 95.0% of questions, 
      internal information in 98.3%, and external information in 97.5%. Upon separating 
      the questions based on incorrect and correct responses, a statistically 
      significant difference was identified in GPT-4's application of logical 
      reasoning. CONCLUSION: GPT-4 has shown to be more accurate and reliable for 
      plastic surgery resident education when compared to GPT-3.5. Users should look to 
      utilize the tool to enhance their educational curriculum. Those who adopt the use 
      of such models may be better equipped to deliver high-quality care to their 
      patients.

AB  - A large law firm typically exhibits a collective intelligence comprised of 
      hundreds or thousands of legal minds aimed at simultaneously engaging thousands 
      of active matters across scores of industries and dozens of practice specialties 
      with distinct doctrinal and procedural characteristics. The firm is challenged 
      not only to achieve successful, cost-effective outcomes for its clients, but must 
      also simultaneously, in competition with other firms and alternative service 
      providers, attract and cultivate talent, develop and coordinate capabilities 
      across multiple evolving areas of practice and continually improve a robust 
      collective intelligence to gain a competitive edge. As various types of machine 
      intelligences and tools are introduced, firms must also groom these into the 
      collective. In this paper we explore a human-machine hybrid system for addressing 
      this large scale, multi-dimensional, dynamic optimization challenge to coordinate 
      a collective intelligence of humans and machines. Machine intelligence is needed 
      to handle the computational complexity and it is complemented by human 
      intelligence to help handle exceptions and novel situations. We believe this 
      approach has potential for transforming the collective intelligence that is the 
      large law firm.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe an evaluation of a generative language model tool to write 
      examination questions for a new elective course focused on the interpretation of 
      common clinical laboratory results being developed as an elective for students in 
      a Bachelor of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences program. METHODS: A total of 100 
      multiple-choice questions were generated using a publicly available large 
      language model for a course dealing with common laboratory values. Two 
      independent evaluators with extensive training and experience in writing 
      multiple-choice questions evaluated each question for appropriate formatting, 
      clarity, correctness, relevancy, and difficulty. For each question, a final 
      dichotomous judgment was assigned by each reviewer, usable as written or not 
      usable written. RESULTS: The major finding of this study was that a generative 
      language model (ChatGPT 3.5) could generate multiple-choice questions for 
      assessing common laboratory value information but only about half the questions 
      (50% and 57% for the 2 evaluators) were deemed usable without modification. 
      General agreement between evaluator comments was common (62% of comments) with 
      more than 1 correct answer being the most common reason for commenting on the 
      lack of usability (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;27). CONCLUSION: The generally positive findings of this 
      study suggest that the use of a generative language model tool for developing 
      examination questions is deserving of further investigation.

AB  - Following the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, interest in large language 
      model (LLM)-powered chatbots has surged with increasing focus on the clinical 
      potential of these tools. Missing from this discussion, however, are the 
      perspectives of physicians. The current study aimed to explore psychiatrists' 
      experiences and opinions on this new generation of chatbots in mental health 
      care. An online survey including both quantitative and qualitative responses was 
      distributed to a non-probability sample of psychiatrists affiliated with the 
      American Psychiatric Association. Findings revealed 44&nbsp;% of psychiatrists had 
      used OpenAI's ChatGPT-3.5 and 33&nbsp;% had used GPT-4.0 "to assist with answering 
      clinical questions." Administrative tasks were cited as a major benefit of these 
      tools: 70&nbsp;% somewhat agreed/agreed "documentation will be/is more efficient". 
      Three in four psychiatrists (75&nbsp;%) somewhat agreed/agreed "the majority of their 
      patients will consult these tools before first seeing a doctor". Nine in ten 
      somewhat agreed/agreed that clinicians need more support/training in 
      understanding these tools. Open-ended responses reflected these opinions but 
      respondents also expressed divergent opinions on the value of generative AI in 
      clinical practice, including its impact on the future of the profession.

TI  - The potential and limitations of large language models in identification of the 
      states of motivations for facilitating health behavior change.
LID - ocae057 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocae057 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: The study highlights the potential and limitations of the Large 
      Language Models (LLMs) in recognizing different states of motivation to provide 
      appropriate information for behavior change. Following the Transtheoretical Model 
      (TTM), we identified the major gap of LLMs in responding to certain states of 
      motivation through validated scenario studies, suggesting future directions of 
      LLMs research for health promotion. OBJECTIVES: The LLMs-based generative 
      conversational agents (GAs) have shown success in identifying user intents 
      semantically. Little is known about its capabilities to identify motivation 
      states and provide appropriate information to facilitate behavior change 
      progression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 3 GAs, ChatGPT, Google Bard, and 
      Llama 2 in identifying motivation states following the TTM stages of change. GAs 
      were evaluated using 25 validated scenarios with 5 health topics across 5 TTM 
      stages. The relevance and completeness of the responses to cover the TTM 
      processes to proceed to the next stage of change were assessed. RESULTS: 3 GAs 
      identified the motivation states in the preparation stage providing sufficient 
      information to proceed to the action stage. The responses to the motivation 
      states in the action and maintenance stages were good enough covering partial 
      processes for individuals to initiate and maintain their changes in behavior. 
      However, the GAs were not able to identify users' motivation states in the 
      precontemplation and contemplation stages providing irrelevant information, 
      covering about 20%-30% of the processes. DISCUSSION: GAs are able to identify 
      users' motivation states and provide relevant information when individuals have 
      established goals and commitments to take and maintain an action. However, 
      individuals who are hesitant or ambivalent about behavior change are unlikely to 
      receive sufficient and relevant guidance to proceed to the next stage of change. 
      CONCLUSION: The current GAs effectively identify motivation states of individuals 
      with established goals but may lack support for those ambivalent towards behavior 
      change.

TI  - The Potential Influence of AI on Population Mental Health.
PG  - e49936
LID - 10.2196/49936 [doi]
LID - e49936
AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into everyday life has galvanized 
      a global conversation on the possibilities and perils of AI on human health. In 
      particular, there is a growing need to anticipate and address the potential 
      impact of widely accessible, enhanced, and conversational AI on mental health. We 
      propose 3 considerations to frame how AI may influence population mental health: 
      through the advancement of mental health care; by altering social and economic 
      contexts; and through the policies that shape the adoption, use, and potential 
      abuse of AI-enhanced tools.

LID - e37850
AB  - We present a case of a four-year-old male with a history of giant omphalocele who 
      underwent ultrasound-guided Botox injection to bilateral anterior abdominal wall 
      musculature in preparation for definitive repair.&nbsp;Botox administration was 
      successfully combined with preoperative subfascial tissue expanders to achieve 
      definitive midline closure of the anterior abdominal wall defect. Our 
      experience&nbsp;suggests that Botox can be safely used as part of the treatment plan 
      for giant omphalocele repair.

AB  - Obesity has become a serious global health problem. For some patients who cannot 
      be treated with traditional methods, artificial intelligence technologies are a 
      new source of hope. Chat GPT is a language model that has become popular in 
      recent times and has many applications in natural language processing. This 
      article focuses on the potential use of Chat GPT in obesity treatment. Chat GPT 
      can provide personalized recommendations on topics, such as nutrition plans, 
      exercise programs, and psychological support. In this way, a personalized 
      treatment plan can be created based on the individual needs of patients and a 
      more effective approach to obesity treatment can be achieved. However, some 
      ethical and security concerns should also be considered regarding the use of this 
      technology. In conclusion, the potential of Chat GPT in obesity treatment is 
      promising, and with the effective use of this technology, better results can be 
      achieved in obesity treatment.

TI  - Fighting reviewer fatigue or amplifying bias? Considerations and recommendations 
      for use of ChatGPT and other large language models in scholarly peer review.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergence of systems based on large language models (LLMs) such 
      as OpenAI's ChatGPT has created a range of discussions in scholarly circles. 
      Since LLMs generate grammatically correct and mostly relevant (yet sometimes 
      outright wrong, irrelevant or biased) outputs in response to provided prompts, 
      using them in various writing tasks including writing peer review reports could 
      result in improved productivity. Given the significance of peer reviews in the 
      existing scholarly publication landscape, exploring challenges and opportunities 
      of using LLMs in peer review seems urgent. After the generation of the first 
      scholarly outputs with LLMs, we anticipate that peer review reports too would be 
      generated with the help of these systems. However, there are currently no 
      guidelines on how these systems should be used in review tasks. METHODS: To 
      investigate the potential impact of using LLMs on the peer review process, we 
      used five core themes within discussions about peer review suggested by Tennant 
      and Ross-Hellauer. These include 1) reviewers' role, 2) editors' role, 3) 
      functions and quality of peer reviews, 4) reproducibility, and 5) the social and 
      epistemic functions of peer reviews. We provide a small-scale exploration of 
      ChatGPT's performance regarding identified issues. RESULTS: LLMs have the 
      potential to substantially alter the role of both peer reviewers and editors. 
      Through supporting both actors in efficiently writing constructive reports or 
      decision letters, LLMs can facilitate higher quality review and address issues of 
      review shortage. However, the fundamental opacity of LLMs'&nbsp;training data, inner 
      workings, data handling, and development processes raise concerns about potential 
      biases, confidentiality and the&nbsp;reproducibility of review reports. Additionally, 
      as editorial work has a prominent function in defining and shaping epistemic 
      communities, as well as negotiating normative frameworks within such communities, 
      partly outsourcing this work to LLMs might have unforeseen consequences for 
      social and epistemic relations within academia. Regarding performance, we 
      identified major enhancements in a short period and expect LLMs to continue 
      developing. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that LLMs are likely to have a profound 
      impact on academia and scholarly communication. While potentially beneficial to 
      the scholarly communication system, many uncertainties remain and their use is 
      not without risks. In particular, concerns about the amplification of existing 
      biases and inequalities in access to appropriate infrastructure warrant further 
      attention. For the moment, we recommend that if LLMs are used to write scholarly 
      reviews and decision letters, reviewers and editors should disclose their use and 
      accept full responsibility for data security and confidentiality, and&nbsp;their 
      reports' accuracy, tone, reasoning and originality.

LID - e39305
AB  - Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize the field of 
      medicine by, among other applications, improving diagnostic accuracy and 
      supporting clinical decision-making. However, the successful integration of LLMs 
      in medicine requires addressing challenges and considerations specific to the 
      medical domain. This viewpoint article provides a comprehensive overview of key 
      aspects for the successful implementation of LLMs in medicine, including transfer 
      learning, domain-specific fine-tuning, domain adaptation, reinforcement learning 
      with expert input, dynamic training, interdisciplinary collaboration, education 
      and training, evaluation metrics, clinical validation, ethical considerations, 
      data privacy, and regulatory frameworks. By adopting a multifaceted approach and 
      fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, LLMs can be developed, validated, and 
      integrated into medical practice responsibly, effectively, and ethically, 
      addressing the needs of various medical disciplines and diverse patient 
      populations. Ultimately, this approach will ensure that LLMs enhance patient care 
      and improve overall health outcomes for all.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) and mental illnesses frequently coexist and are both extremely 
      common worldwide. Through the National Program for Elimination of Tuberculosis 
      (NTEP), anti-tuberculosis therapy (ATT) medications are used to treat 
      tuberculosis in India. We want to report a case 45-year-old patient from the 
      state of Andhra Pradesh, India with comorbid delusional disorder leading to daily 
      ATT drug consumption for the past 20 years. This unusual presentation 
      demonstrates that abuse of a Schedule "H" substance like ATT is also conceivable. 
      To stop "Off-label" purchases, strict measures must be taken. Before beginning 
      ATT, evaluating the patient's mental health may be a wise move.

TI  - Development of a liver disease-Specific large language model chat Interface using 
      retrieval augmented generation.
LID - 10.1097/HEP.0000000000000834 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Large language models (LLMs) have significant capabilities in 
      clinical information processing tasks. Commercially available LLMs, however, are 
      not optimized for clinical uses and are prone to generating hallucinatory 
      information. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an enterprise architecture 
      that allows embedding of customized data into LLMs. This approach "specializes" 
      the LLMs and is thought to reduce hallucinations. METHODS: We developed 
      "LiVersa," a liver disease-specific LLM, by using our institution's protected 
      health information (PHI)-complaint text embedding and LLM platform, "Versa." We 
      conducted RAG on 30 publicly available American Association for the Study of 
      Liver Diseases guidance documents to be incorporated into LiVersa. RESULTS: We 
      evaluated LiVersa's performance by conducting two rounds of testing. First, we 
      compared LiVersa's outputs versus those of trainees from a previously published 
      knowledge assessment. LiVersa answered all 10 questions correctly. Second, we 
      asked 15 hepatologists to evaluate the outputs to ten hepatology topic questions 
      generated by LiVersa, OpenAI's ChatGPT 4, and Meta's LLaMA 2. LiVersa's outputs 
      were more accurate but were rated less comprehensive and safe compared to those 
      of ChatGPT 4. DISCUSSION: In this demonstration, we built a disease-specific and 
      PHI-compliant LLMs using RAG. While LiVersa demonstrated higher accuracy in 
      answering questions related to hepatology - there were some deficiencies due to 
      limitations set by the number of documents used for RAG. LiVersa will likely 
      require further refinement before potential live deployment. The LiVersa 
      prototype, however, is a proof of concept for utilizing RAG to customize LLMs for 
      clinical use cases.

TI  - Exploring Generative Artificial Intelligence-Assisted Medical Education: 
      Assessing Case-Based Learning for Medical Students.
PG  - e51961
LID - 10.7759/cureus.51961 [doi]
LID - e51961
AB  - The recent public release of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has 
      brought fresh excitement by making access to GenAI for medical education easier 
      than ever before. It is now incumbent upon both students and faculty to determine 
      the optimal role of GenAI within the medical school curriculum. Given the promise 
      and limitations of GenAI, this study aims to assess the current capabilities of a 
      GenAI (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer, ChatGPT), specifically within the 
      framework of a pre-clerkship case-based active learning curriculum. The role of 
      GenAI is explored by evaluating its performance in generating educational 
      materials, creating medical assessment questions, answering medical queries, and 
      engaging in clinical reasoning by prompting it to respond to a problem-based 
      learning scenario. Our results demonstrated that GenAI addressed epidemiology, 
      diagnosis, and treatment questions well. However, there were still instances 
      where it failed to provide comprehensive answers. Responses from GenAI might 
      offer essential information, hint at the need for further inquiry, or sometimes 
      omit critical details. GenAI struggled with generating information on complex 
      topics, raising a significant concern when using it as a 'search engine' for 
      medical student queries. This creates uncertainty for students regarding 
      potentially missed critical information. With the increasing integration of GenAI 
      into medical education, it is imperative for faculty to become well-versed in 
      both its advantages and limitations. This awareness will enable them to educate 
      students on using GenAI effectively in medical education.

TI  - ChatGPT and mental healthcare: balancing benefits with risks of harms.
LID - 10.1136/bmjment-2023-300884 [doi]
LID - e300884
AB  - Against the global need for increased access to mental services, health 
      organisations are looking to technological advances to improve the delivery of 
      care and lower costs. Since November 2022, with the public launch of OpenAI's 
      ChatGPT, the field of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has received 
      expanding attention. Although generative AI itself is not new, technical advances 
      and the increased accessibility of large language models (LLMs) (eg, OpenAI's 
      GPT-4 and Google's Bard) suggest use of these tools could be clinically 
      significant. LLMs are an application of generative AI technology that can 
      summarise and generate content based on training on vast data sets. Unlike search 
      engines, which provide internet links in response to typed entries, chatbots that 
      rely on generative language models can simulate dialogue that resembles human 
      conversations. We examine the potential promise and the risks of using LLMs in 
      mental healthcare today, focusing on their scope to impact mental healthcare, 
      including global equity in the delivery of care. Although we caution that LLMs 
      should not be used to disintermediate mental health clinicians, we signal how-if 
      carefully implemented-in the long term these tools could reap benefits for 
      patients and health professionals.

TI  - Quantitative Evaluation of Large Language Models to Streamline Radiology Report 
      Impressions: A Multimodal Retrospective Analysis.
PG  - e231593
LID - 10.1148/radiol.231593 [doi]
AB  - Background The complex medical terminology of radiology reports may cause 
      confusion or anxiety for patients, especially given increased access to 
      electronic health records. Large language models (LLMs) can potentially simplify 
      radiology report readability. Purpose To compare the performance of four publicly 
      available LLMs (ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4, Bard [now known as Gemini], and Bing) 
      in producing simplified radiology report impressions. Materials and Methods In 
      this retrospective comparative analysis of the four LLMs (accessed July 23 to 
      July 26, 2023), the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV 
      database was used to gather 750 anonymized radiology report impressions covering 
      a range of imaging modalities (MRI, CT, US, radiography, mammography) and 
      anatomic regions. Three distinct prompts were employed to assess the LLMs' 
      ability to simplify report impressions. The first prompt (prompt 1) was "Simplify 
      this radiology report." The second prompt (prompt 2) was "I am a patient. 
      Simplify this radiology report." The last prompt (prompt 3) was "Simplify this 
      radiology report at the 7th grade level." Each prompt was followed by the 
      radiology report impression and was queried once. The primary outcome was 
      simplification as assessed by readability score. Readability was assessed using 
      the average of four established readability indexes. The nonparametric Wilcoxon 
      signed-rank test was applied to compare reading grade levels across LLM output. 
      Results All four LLMs simplified radiology report impressions across all prompts 
      tested (P &lt; .001). Within prompts, differences were found between LLMs. Providing 
      the context of being a patient or requesting simplification at the seventh-grade 
      level reduced the reading grade level of output for all models and prompts 
      (except prompt 1 to prompt 2 for ChatGPT-4) (P &lt; .001). Conclusion Although the 
      success of each LLM varied depending on the specific prompt wording, all four 
      models simplified radiology report impressions across all modalities and prompts 
      tested. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article. See

TI  - Safety of Large Language Models in Addressing Depression.
PG  - e50729
LID - 10.7759/cureus.50729 [doi]
LID - e50729
AB  - Background Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models, exemplified by systems 
      such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Anthropic, are currently under intense investigation 
      for their potential to address existing gaps in mental health support. One 
      implementation of these large language models involves the development of mental 
      health-focused conversational agents, which utilize pre-structured prompts to 
      facilitate user interaction without requiring specialized knowledge in prompt 
      engineering. However, uncertainties persist regarding the safety and efficacy of 
      these agents in recognizing severe depression and suicidal tendencies. Given the 
      well-established correlation between the severity of depression and the risk of 
      suicide, improperly calibrated conversational agents may inadequately identify 
      and respond to crises. Consequently, it is crucial to investigate whether 
      publicly accessible repositories of mental health-focused conversational agents 
      can consistently and safely address crisis scenarios before considering their 
      adoption in clinical settings. This study assesses the safety of publicly 
      available ChatGPT-3.5 conversational agents by evaluating their responses to a 
      patient simulation indicating worsening depression and suicidality. Methodology 
      This study evaluated ChatGPT-3.5 conversational agents on a publicly available 
      repository specifically designed for mental health counseling. Each 
      conversational agent was evaluated twice by a highly structured patient 
      simulation. First, the simulation indicated escalating suicide risk based on the 
      Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). For the second patient simulation, the 
      escalating risk was presented in a more generalized manner not associated with an 
      existing risk scale to assess the more generalized ability of the conversational 
      agent to recognize suicidality. Each simulation recorded the exact point at which 
      the conversational agent recommended human support. Then, the simulation 
      continued until the conversational agent stopped entirely and shut down 
      completely, insisting on human intervention. Results All 25 agents available on 
      the public repository FlowGPT.com were evaluated. The point at which the 
      conversational agents referred to a human occurred around the mid-point of the 
      simulation, and definitive shutdown predominantly only happened at the highest 
      risk levels. For the PHQ-9 simulation, the average initial referral and shutdown 
      aligned with PHQ-9 scores of 12 (moderate depression) and 25 (severe depression). 
      Few agents included crisis resources - only two referenced suicide hotlines. 
      Despite the conversational agents insisting on human intervention, 22 out of 25 
      agents would eventually resume the dialogue if the simulation reverted to a lower 
      risk level. Conclusions Current generative AI-based conversational agents are 
      slow to escalate mental health risk scenarios, postponing referral to a human to 
      potentially dangerous levels. More rigorous testing and oversight of 
      conversational agents are needed before deployment in mental healthcare settings. 
      Additionally, further investigation should explore if sustained engagement 
      worsens outcomes and whether enhanced accessibility outweighs the risks of 
      improper escalation. Advancing AI safety in mental health remains imperative as 
      these technologies continue rapidly advancing.

LID - e25390
AB  - In order to enhance the operational efficiency of the healthcare industry, this 
      paper investigates a medical information diagnostic platform through the 
      application of swarm and evolutionary algorithms. This paper begins with an 
      analysis of the current development status of medical information diagnostic 
      platforms based on Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) and Internet 
      of Things (IoT) technology. Subsequently, a comprehensive exploration of the 
      advantages and disadvantages of swarm and evolutionary algorithms within the 
      medical information diagnostic platform is presented. Further, the optimization 
      of the swarm algorithm is achieved through reverse learning and Gaussian 
      functions. The rationality and effectiveness of the proposed optimization 
      algorithm are validated through horizontal comparative experiments. Experimental 
      results demonstrate that the optimized model achieves favorable performance at 
      the levels of minimum, average, and maximum algorithm fitness values. 
      Additionally, preprocessing data in a 10&nbsp;*&nbsp;10 server configuration enhances the 
      algorithm's fitness values. The minimum fitness value obtained by the optimized 
      algorithm is 3.56, representing a 3&nbsp;% improvement compared to the minimum value 
      without sorting. In comparative experiments on algorithm stability, the optimized 
      algorithm exhibits the best stability, with further enhancement observed when 
      using sorting algorithms. Therefore, this paper not only provides a new 
      perspective for the field of medical information diagnostics but also offers 
      effective technical support for practical applications in medical information 
      processing.

AB  - The rapid development of big data methods and technologies has provided more and 
      more new ideas and methods for clinical diagnosis and treatment. The emergence of 
      large language models (LLM) has made it possible for human-computer interactive 
      dialogues and applications in complex medical scenarios. Critical care medicine 
      is a process of continuous dynamic targeted treatment. The huge data generated in 
      this process needs to be integrated and optimized through models for clinical 
      application, interaction in teaching simulation, and assistance in scientific 
      research. Using the LLM represented by generative pre-trained transformer ChatGPT 
      can initially realize the application in the diagnosis of severe diseases, the 
      prediction of death risk and the management of medical records. At the same time, 
      the time and space limitations, illusions and ethical and moral issues of ChatGPT 
      emerged as the times require. In the future, it is undeniable that it may play a 
      huge role in the diagnosis and treatment of critical care medicine, but the 
      current application should be combined with more clinical knowledge reserves of 
      critical care medicine to carefully judge its conclusions.

LID - 1295721
AB  - The role of a scientist is at first not so different from a philosopher. They 
      both need to question common thinking and evaluate whether reality is not as we 
      always thought. Based on this, we need to design hypotheses, experiments, and 
      analyses to prove our alternative vision. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly 
      moving from an "assistant" into a proper "colleague" for literature mining, data 
      analysis and interpretation, and literally having (almost) real scientific 
      conversations. However, being AI based on existing information, if we rely on it 
      excessively will we still be able to question the status quo? In this article, we 
      are particularly interested in discussing the future of proteomics and mass 
      spectrometry with our new electronic collaborator. We leave to the reader the 
      judgement whether the answers we received are satisfactory or superficial. What 
      we were mostly interested in was laying down what we think are critical questions 
      that the proteomics community should occasionally ask to itself. Proteomics has 
      been around for more than 30&nbsp;years, but it is still missing a few critical steps 
      to fully address its promises as being the new genomics for clinical diagnostics 
      and fundamental science, while becoming a user-friendly tool for every lab. Will 
      we get there with the help of AI? And will these answers change in a short 
      period, as AI continues to advance?

TI  - Delayed Skin Allergy to Glucosamine Chondroitin Supplement.
PG  - e36310

LID - e36310
AB  - Glucosamine chondroitin is a popular dietary supplement used for joint health and 
      osteoarthritis pain and is one of the dietary supplements commonly recommended by 
      chiropractors. Herein, we present the case of a 36-year-old woman who developed a 
      skin rash with delayed onset after taking glucosamine and chondroitin pills for 
      lumbar degenerative joint disease. Within 3 hours of taking the supplement, she 
      developed an itchy rash on her torso and legs. Over the next few hours, the rash 
      spread over her entire body, and facial swelling developed. Given the timing of 
      the symptoms after the administration of glucosamine chondroitin, an allergic 
      reaction was suspected. The supplement was withdrawn and the allergic reactions 
      were treated with antihistamines and steroids for several days. This case report 
      demonstrates the need to recognize delayed allergic reactions as a potential side 
      effect of widely used supplements, such as glucosamine chondroitin, which can 
      produce hypersensitivity reactions in sensitive individuals.

TI  - Assessing the Utilization of Large Language Models in Medical Education: Insights 
      From Undergraduate Medical Students.
PG  - e47468
LID - 10.7759/cureus.47468 [doi]
LID - e47468
AB  - Background Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to be integrated into 
      medical education. Among AI-based technology, large language models (LLMs) such 
      as ChatGPT, Google Bard, Microsoft Bing, and Perplexity have emerged as powerful 
      tools with capabilities in natural language processing. With this background, 
      this study investigates the knowledge, attitude, and practice of undergraduate 
      medical students regarding the utilization of LLMs in medical education in a 
      medical college in Jharkhand, India. Methods A cross-sectional online survey was 
      sent to 370 undergraduate medical students on Google Forms. The questionnaire 
      comprised the following three domains: knowledge, attitude, and practice, each 
      containing six questions. Cronbach's alphas for knowledge, attitude, and practice 
      domains were 0.703, 0.707, and 0.809, respectively. Intraclass correlation 
      coefficients for knowledge, attitude, and practice domains were 0.82, 0.87, and 
      0.78, respectively. The average scores in the three domains were compared using 
      ANOVA. Results A total of 172 students participated in the study (response rate: 
      46.49%). The majority of the students (45.93%) rarely used the LLMs for their 
      teaching-learning purposes (chi-square (3) = 41.44, p &lt; 0.0001). The overall 
      score of knowledge (3.21±0.55), attitude (3.47±0.54), and practice (3.26±0.61) 
      were statistically significantly different (ANOVA F (2, 513) = 10.2, p &lt; 0.0001), 
      with the highest score in attitude and lowest in knowledge. Conclusion While 
      there is a generally positive attitude toward the incorporation of LLMs in 
      medical education, concerns about overreliance and potential inaccuracies are 
      evident. LLMs offer the potential to enhance learning resources and provide 
      accessible education, but their integration requires further planning. Further 
      studies are required to explore the long-term impact of LLMs in diverse 
      educational contexts.

LID - 10.1101/2023.09.29.23296239 [doi]
AB  - Though electronic health record (EHR) systems are a rich repository of clinical 
      information with large potential, the use of EHR-based phenotyping algorithms is 
      often hindered by inaccurate diagnostic records, the presence of many irrelevant 
      features, and the requirement for a human-labeled training set. In this paper, we 
      describe a knowledge-driven online multimodal automated phenotyping (KOMAP) 
      system that i) generates a list of informative features by an online narrative 
      and codified feature search engine (ONCE) and ii) enables the training of a 
      multimodal phenotyping algorithm based on summary data. Powered by composite 
      knowledge from multiple EHR sources, online article corpora, and a large language 
      model, features selected by ONCE show high concordance with the state-of-the-art 
      AI models (GPT4 and ChatGPT) and encourage large-scale phenotyping by providing a 
      smaller but highly relevant feature set. Validation of the KOMAP system across 
      four healthcare centers suggests that it can generate efficient phenotyping 
      algorithms with robust performance. Compared to other methods requiring 
      patient-level inputs and gold-standard labels, the fully online KOMAP provides a 
      significant opportunity to enable multi-center collaboration.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The American Medical Association recommends health information to be 
      written at a 6th grade level reading level. Our aim was to determine whether 
      Artificial Intelligence can outperform the existing health information on kidney 
      stone prevention and treatment. METHODS: The top 50 search results for "Kidney 
      Stone Prevention" and "Kidney Stone Treatment" on Google, Bing, and Yahoo were 
      selected. Duplicate webpages, advertisements, pages intended for health 
      professionals such as science articles, links to videos, paid subscription pages, 
      and links nonrelated to kidney stone prevention and/or treatment were excluded. 
      Included pages were categorized into academic, hospital-affiliated, commercial, 
      nonprofit foundations, and other. Quality and readability of webpages were 
      evaluated using validated tools, and the reading level was descriptively compared 
      with ChatGPT generated health information on kidney stone prevention and 
      treatment. RESULTS: 50 webpages on kidney stone prevention and 49 on stone 
      treatment were included in this study. The reading level was determined to equate 
      to that of a 10th to 12th grade student. Quality was measured as "fair" with no 
      pages scoring "excellent" and only 20% receiving a "good" quality. There was no 
      significant difference between pages from academic, hospital-affiliated, 
      commercial, and nonprofit foundation publications. The text generated by ChatGPT 
      was considerably easier to understand with readability levels measured as low as 
      5th grade. CONCLUSIONS: The language used in existing information on kidney stone 
      disease is of subpar quality and too complex to understand. Machine learning 
      tools could aid in generating information that is comprehensible by the public.

TI  - Transcription between human-readable synthetic descriptions and 
      machine-executable instructions: an application of the latest pre-training 
      technology.
PG  - 9360-9373
LID - 10.1039/d3sc02483k [doi]
AB  - AI has been widely applied in scientific scenarios, such as robots performing 
      chemical synthetic actions to free researchers from monotonous experimental 
      procedures. However, there exists a gap between human-readable natural language 
      descriptions and machine-executable instructions, of which the former are 
      typically in numerous chemical articles, and the latter are currently compiled 
      manually by experts. We apply the latest technology of pre-trained models and 
      achieve automatic transcription between descriptions and instructions. We design 
      a concise and comprehensive schema of instructions and construct an open-source 
      human-annotated dataset consisting of 3950 description-instruction pairs, with 
      9.2 operations in each instruction on average. We further propose knowledgeable 
      pre-trained transcription models enhanced by multi-grained chemical knowledge. 
      The performance of recent popular models and products showing great capability in 
      automatic writing (e.g., ChatGPT) has also been explored. Experiments prove that 
      our system improves the instruction compilation efficiency of researchers by at 
      least 42%, and can generate fluent academic paragraphs of synthetic descriptions 
      when given instructions, showing the great potential of pre-trained models in 
      improving human productivity.

TI  - COHUMAIN: Building the Socio-Cognitive Architecture of Collective Human-Machine 
      Intelligence.
LID - 10.1111/tops.12673 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, we have experienced rapid development of advanced technology, 
      machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI), intended to interact with and 
      augment the abilities of humans in practically every area of life. With the rapid 
      growth of new capabilities, such as those enabled by generative AI (e.g., 
      ChatGPT), AI is increasingly at the center of human communication and 
      collaboration, resulting in a growing recognition of the need to understand how 
      humans and AI can integrate their inputs in collaborative teams. However, there 
      are many unanswered questions regarding how human-AI collective intelligence will 
      emerge and what the barriers might be. Truly integrated collaboration between 
      humans and intelligent agents may result in a different way of working that looks 
      nothing like what we know now, and it is important to keep the essential goal of 
      human societal well-being and prosperity a priority. In this special issue, we 
      begin to scope out the underpinnings of a socio-cognitive architecture for 
      Collective HUman-MAchine INtelligence (COHUMAIN), which is the study of the 
      capability of an integrated human and machine (i.e., intelligent technology) 
      system to achieve goals in a wide range of environments. This topic consists of 
      nine papers including a description of the conceptual foundation for a 
      socio-cognitive architecture for COHUMAIN, empirical tests of some aspects of 
      this architecture, research on proposed representations of intelligent agents 
      that can jointly interact with humans, empirical tests of human-human and 
      human-machine interactions, and philosophical and ethical issues to consider as 
      we develop these systems.

AB  - Recent developments making an artificial intelligence (AI) large language model 
      available for public use have generated significant interest and angst among 
      educators. Viewed as both a time saver and a threat to academic integrity, 
      several questions have arisen about AI's role in education. Numerous 
      opportunities exist to use AI for teaching and learning, but new questions have 
      also arisen regarding AI's impact on the future of healthcare. The pharmacy 
      Academy should be at the center of these discussions to address the technical, 
      philosophical, and ethical issues that AI presents for the future of pharmacy and 
      pharmacy education.

TI  - Objective and subjective assessment of Dupuytren's contracture.
PG  - 74-78
LID - 10.48095/ccachp202374 [doi]
AB  - This paper describes the evaluation options of Dupuytren's&nbsp;contracture by 
      subjective and objective methods. There are various classification schemes named 
      after their authors, including graphical representation for objective evaluation 
      of the disease. Subjective assessment was performed in the form of 
      a&nbsp;questionnaire for patients. The QuickDASH with a&nbsp;small specification for 
      Dupuytren's&nbsp;contracture is the most commonly used questionnaire. The Southampton 
      Dupuytren's&nbsp;Scoring Scheme questionnaire appears to be a&nbsp;higher specification. 
      The classifications allow evaluation of treatment success to determine prognosis 
      of the disease. The analysis of articles is based on PubMed search from the years 
      1967-2022, with 28 relevant articles were retrieved. Based on this analysis, the 
      Tubiana classification appears to be the most appropriate one for patients with 
      Dupuytren's&nbsp;contracture. Of patient questionnaires, the Southampton 
      Dupuytren's&nbsp;Scoring Scheme meets these parameters.

TI  - Embracing the future-is artificial intelligence already better? A comparative 
      study of artificial intelligence performance in diagnostic accuracy and

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in 
      healthcare has the potential to revolutionize patient care and clinical 
      decision-making. This study aimed to explore the reliability of large language 
      models in neurology by comparing the performance of an AI chatbot with 
      neurologists in diagnostic accuracy and decision-making. METHODS: A 
      cross-sectional observational study was conducted. A pool of clinical cases from 
      the American Academy of Neurology's Question of the Day application was used as 
      the basis for the study. The AI chatbot used was ChatGPT, based on GPT-3.5. The 
      results were then compared to neurology peers who also answered the questions-a 
      mean of 1500 neurologists/neurology residents. RESULTS: The study included 188 
      questions across 22 different categories. The AI chatbot demonstrated a mean 
      success rate of 71.3% in providing correct answers, with varying levels of 
      proficiency across different neurology categories. Compared to neurology peers, 
      the AI chatbot performed at a similar level, with a mean success rate of 69.2% 
      amongst peers. Additionally, the AI chatbot achieved a correct diagnosis in 85.0% 
      of cases and it provided an adequate justification for its correct responses in 
      96.1%. CONCLUSIONS: The study highlights the potential of AI, particularly large 
      language models, in assisting with clinical reasoning and decision-making in 
      neurology and emphasizes the importance of AI as a complementary tool to human 
      expertise. Future advancements and refinements are needed to enhance the AI 
      chatbot's performance and broaden its application across various medical 
      specialties.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have transformed 
      health care with applications in various specialized fields. Neurosurgery can 
      benefit from artificial intelligence in surgical planning, predicting patient 
      outcomes, and analyzing neuroimaging data. GPT-4, an updated language model with 
      additional training parameters, has exhibited exceptional performance on 
      standardized exams. This study examines GPT-4's competence on neurosurgical 
      board-style questions, comparing its performance with medical students and 
      residents, to explore its potential in medical education and clinical 
      decision-making. METHODS: GPT-4's performance was examined on 643 Congress of 
      Neurological Surgeons Self-Assessment Neurosurgery Exam (SANS) board-style 
      questions from various neurosurgery subspecialties. Of these, 477 were text-based 
      and 166 contained images. GPT-4 refused to answer 52 questions that contained no 
      text. The remaining 591 questions were inputted into GPT-4, and its performance 
      was evaluated based on first-time responses. Raw scores were analyzed across 
      subspecialties and question types, and then compared to previous findings on Chat 
      Generative pre-trained transformer performance against SANS users, medical 
      students, and neurosurgery residents. RESULTS: GPT-4 attempted 91.9% of Congress 
      of Neurological Surgeons SANS questions and achieved 76.6% accuracy. The model's 
      accuracy increased to 79.0% for text-only questions. GPT-4 outperformed Chat 
      Generative pre-trained transformer (P &lt; 0.001) and scored highest in 
      pain/peripheral nerve (84%) and lowest in spine (73%) categories. It exceeded the 
      performance of medical students (26.3%), neurosurgery residents (61.5%), and the 
      national average of SANS users (69.3%) across all categories. CONCLUSIONS: GPT-4 
      significantly outperformed medical students, neurosurgery residents, and the 
      national average of SANS users. The mode's accuracy suggests potential 
      applications in educational settings and clinical decision-making, enhancing 
      provider efficiency, and improving patient care.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence as a Triage Tool during the Perioperative Period: Pilot 
      Study of Accuracy and Accessibility for Clinical Application.
PG  - e5580
LID - 10.1097/GOX.0000000000005580 [doi]
LID - e5580
AB  - BACKGROUND: Given the dialogistic properties of ChatGPT, we hypothesized that 
      this artificial intelligence (AI) function can be used as a self-service tool 
      where clinical questions can be directly answered by AI. Our objective was to 
      assess the content, accuracy, and accessibility of AI-generated content regarding 
      common perioperative questions for reduction mammaplasty. METHODS: ChatGPT 
      (OpenAI, February Version, San Francisco, Calif.) was used to query 20 common 
      patient concerns that arise in the perioperative period of a reduction 
      mammaplasty. Searches were performed in duplicate for both a general term and a 
      specific clinical question. Query outputs were analyzed both objectively and 
      subjectively. Descriptive statistics, t tests, and chi-square tests were 
      performed where appropriate with a predetermined level of significance of P less 
      than 0.05. RESULTS: From a total of 40 AI-generated outputs, mean word length was 
      191.8 words. Readability was at the thirteenth grade level. Regarding content, of 
      all query outputs, 97.5% were on the appropriate topic. Medical advice was deemed 
      to be reasonable in 100% of cases. General queries more frequently reported 
      overarching background information, whereas specific queries more frequently 
      reported prescriptive information (P &lt; 0.0001). AI outputs specifically 
      recommended following surgeon provided postoperative instructions in 82.5% of 
      instances. CONCLUSIONS: Currently available AI tools, in their nascent form, can 
      provide recommendations for common perioperative questions and concerns for 
      reduction mammaplasty. With further calibration, AI interfaces may serve as a 
      tool for fielding patient queries in the future; however, patients must always 
      retain the ability to bypass technology and be able to contact their surgeon.

LID - e37451
AB  - Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is a rare neurological disorder that is present at 
      birth. It is characterized by a reddish-purple birthmark on the face, typically 
      on one side of the forehead and upper eyelid, and sometimes involving the scalp 
      and ear. This birthmark, called a port-wine stain, is caused by an abnormal 
      buildup of blood vessels in the skin. SWS can also cause neurological problems 
      such as seizures, developmental delays, and problems with vision and 
      coordination. Treatment for SWS typically includes a combination of medications 
      to control seizures and other symptoms, as well as laser therapy or surgery to 
      reduce the appearance of the birthmark. Additionally, physical therapy and other 
      therapies can help improve vision and coordination. It is important to note that 
      the symptoms and severity of SWS can vary widely from person to person, and early 
      diagnosis and treatment can help improve outcomes.

LID - e35484
AB  - Radiation-induced aortitis is a rare but potentially serious complication of 
      radiotherapy. We report the case of a 46-year-old female with a history of 
      cervical cancer who developed radiation-induced aortitis following two courses of 
      concurrent chemoradiation. The patient was asymptomatic, and the condition was 
      detected during a routine follow-up positron emission tomography (PET)&nbsp;scan. The 
      patient was referred to rheumatology for differential diagnosis, which ruled out 
      non-radiation-induced aortitis. The condition was managed conservatively, and a 
      follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan showed resolution of the aortitis but the 
      progression of aorto-iliac fibrosis. The patient was then started on prednisone, 
      which led to a regression of the aorto-iliac vessel thickening.

AB  - The 1920s mark the rise of robots in the human lexicon. Karel Capek, a Czech 
      playwright, wrote R. U. R., which stands for Rossumovi Univerzalnı Roboti or 
      Rossum's Universal Robots. The word for worker or labourer in Czech is robota; 
      Karel was given the idea for this word by his artist brother Josef, and the word 
      robot for a humanmanufactured humanoid entity was born in 1920. November 30, 
      2022, just over a century later, was when ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained 
      Transformer), a chat robot, chatter bot or advanced chatbot, was made available 
      by the company OpenAI for free download.

TI  - Performance Comparison of ChatGPT-4 and Japanese Medical Residents in the General 
      Medicine In-Training Examination: Comparison Study.
PG  - e52202
LID - 10.2196/52202 [doi]
LID - e52202
AB  - BACKGROUND: The reliability of GPT-4, a state-of-the-art expansive language model 
      specializing in clinical reasoning and medical knowledge, remains largely 
      unverified across non-English languages. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare 
      fundamental clinical competencies between Japanese residents and GPT-4 by using 
      the General Medicine In-Training Examination (GM-ITE). METHODS: We used the GPT-4 
      model provided by OpenAI and the GM-ITE examination questions for the years 2020, 
      2021, and 2022 to conduct a comparative analysis. This analysis focused on 
      evaluating the performance of individuals who were concluding their second year 
      of residency in comparison to that of GPT-4. Given the current abilities of 
      GPT-4, our study included only single-choice exam questions, excluding those 
      involving audio, video, or image data. The assessment included 4 categories: 
      general theory (professionalism and medical interviewing), symptomatology and 
      clinical reasoning, physical examinations and clinical procedures, and specific 
      diseases. Additionally, we categorized the questions into 7 specialty fields and 
      3 levels of difficulty, which were determined based on residents' correct 
      response rates. RESULTS: Upon examination of 137 GM-ITE questions in Japanese, 
      GPT-4 scores were significantly higher than the mean scores of residents 
      (residents: 55.8%, GPT-4: 70.1%; P&lt;.001). In terms of specific disciplines, GPT-4 
      scored 23.5 points higher in the "specific diseases," 30.9 points higher in 
      "obstetrics and gynecology," and 26.1 points higher in "internal medicine." In 
      contrast, GPT-4 scores in "medical interviewing and professionalism," "general 
      practice," and "psychiatry" were lower than those of the residents, although this 
      discrepancy was not statistically significant. Upon analyzing scores based on 
      question difficulty, GPT-4 scores were 17.2 points lower for easy problems 
      (P=.007) but were 25.4 and 24.4 points higher for normal and difficult problems, 
      respectively (P&lt;.001). In year-on-year comparisons, GPT-4 scores were 21.7 and 
      21.5 points higher in the 2020 (P=.01) and 2022 (P=.003) examinations, 
      respectively, but only 3.5 points higher in the 2021 examinations (no significant 
      difference). CONCLUSIONS: In the Japanese language, GPT-4 also outperformed the 
      average medical residents in the GM-ITE test, originally designed for them. 
      Specifically, GPT-4 demonstrated a tendency to score higher on difficult 
      questions with low resident correct response rates and those demanding a more 
      comprehensive understanding of diseases. However, GPT-4 scored comparatively 
      lower on questions that residents could readily answer, such as those testing 
      attitudes toward patients and professionalism, as well as those necessitating an 
      understanding of context and communication. These findings highlight the 
      strengths and limitations of artificial intelligence applications in medical 
      education and practice.

AB  - Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) have recently demonstrated excellent 
      performance in various natural language tasks. The development of ChatGPT and the 
      recently released GPT-4 model has shown competence in solving complex and 
      higher-order reasoning tasks without further training or fine-tuning. However, 
      the applicability and strength of these models in classifying legal texts in the 
      context of argument mining are yet to be realized and have not been tested 
      thoroughly. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of GPT-like models, 
      specifically GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, for argument mining via prompting. We closely 
      study the model's performance considering diverse prompt formulation and example 
      selection in the prompt via semantic search using state-of-the-art embedding 
      models from OpenAI and sentence transformers. We primarily concentrate on the 
      argument component classification task on the legal corpus from the European 
      Court of Human Rights. To address these models' inherent non-deterministic nature 
      and make our result statistically sound, we conducted 5-fold cross-validation on 
      the test set. Our experiments demonstrate, quite surprisingly, that relatively 
      small domain-specific models outperform GPT 3.5 and GPT-4 in the F1-score for 
      premise and conclusion classes, with 1.9% and 12% improvements, respectively. We 
      hypothesize that the performance drop indirectly reflects the complexity of the 
      structure in the dataset, which we verify through prompt and data analysis. 
      Nevertheless, our results demonstrate a noteworthy variation in the performance 
      of GPT models based on prompt formulation. We observe comparable performance 
      between the two embedding models, with a slight improvement in the local model's 
      ability for prompt selection. This suggests that local models are as semantically 
      rich as the embeddings from the OpenAI model. Our results indicate that the 
      structure of prompts significantly impacts the performance of GPT models and 
      should be considered when designing them.

AB  - PURPOSE: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools to aid in summarizing 
      information in medicine and research has recently garnered a huge amount of 
      interest. While tools such as ChatGPT produce convincing and naturally sounding 
      output, the answers are sometimes incorrect. Some of these drawbacks, it is 
      hoped, can be avoided by using programmes trained for a more specific scope. In 
      this study we compared the performance of a new AI tool (the-literature.com) to 
      the latest version OpenAI's ChatGPT (GPT-4) in summarizing topics that the 
      authors have significantly contributed to. METHODS: The AI tools were asked to 
      produce a literature review on 7 topics. These were selected based on the 
      research topics that the authors were intimately familiar with and have 
      contributed to through their own publications. The output produced by the AI 
      tools were graded on a 1-5 Likert scale for accuracy, comprehensiveness, and 
      relevance by two fellowship trained consultant radiologists. RESULTS: 
      The-literature.com produced 3 excellent summaries, 3 very poor summaries not 
      relevant to the prompt, and one summary, which was relevant but did not include 
      all relevant papers. All of the summaries produced by GPT-4 were relevant, but 
      fewer relevant papers were identified. The average Likert rating was for 
      the-literature was 2.88 and 3.86 for GPT-4. There was good agreement between the 
      ratings of both radiologists (ICC&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.883). CONCLUSION: Summaries produced by AI 
      in its current state require careful human validation. GPT-4 on average provides 
      higher quality summaries. Neither tool can reliably identify all relevant 
      publications.

TI  - Assessment of a large language model's utility in helping pathology professionals 
      answer general knowledge pathology questions.
PG  - 42-48
LID - 10.1093/ajcp/aqad106 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the utility and performance of the large language model 
      ChatGPT 4.0 regarding accuracy, completeness, and its potential as a time-saving 
      tool for pathologists and laboratory directors. METHODS: A deidentified database 
      of questions previously sent to pathology residents from health care providers 
      was used as a source of general knowledge-type pathology questions. These 
      questions were submitted to the large language model and the responses graded by 
      subject matter experts in different pathology subspecialties. The grading 
      criteria assessed accuracy, completeness, and the potential time savings for 
      helping the pathologist craft the response. RESULTS: Overall, respondents thought 
      that most of the answers would take less than 5 minutes of additional work to be 
      used (85%). Accuracy and completeness for the 61 questions was high, with 98% of 
      responses being at least "completely or mostly accurate" and 82% of responses 
      "containing all relevant information." Of the respondents, 97% stated that the 
      response would have "zero or near-zero potential for medical harm," and all 
      thought the tool had potential to save time in constructing answers to health 
      care providers' queries. Performance was similar in both Anatomic Pathology (AP) 
      and Clinical Pathology (CP), with the only exception being some relevant 
      information was excluded in 46% of AP answers vs only 10% in CP (P &lt; .01). 
      CONCLUSIONS: ChatGPT version 4.0 gave responses that were predominantly accurate 
      and complete for general knowledge-type pathology questions. With further 
      research and when reviewed by a pathologist or laboratorian, this could 
      facilitate its use as a pathologist's aid in answering questions from health care 
      providers.

LID - e34699
AB  - A stroke, also known as cerebrovascular accident (CVA), is a medical condition 
      that occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted, resulting in brain 
      cell death. Cancer-associated stroke (CAS) is a rare but serious complication of 
      cancer, where a malignant tumor or its metastases invade or compress the blood 
      vessels in the brain, resulting in a stroke. We describe a case of a 60-year-old 
      male patient recently diagnosed with lung cancer with metastasis to the liver, 
      esophagus, small intestine, and pancreas who has had at least three CVAs&nbsp;within a 
      span of three months. He developed sequelae such as hemiplegia and aphasia. He 
      was managed with dual antiplatelet therapy, neuroprotective drugs, and 
      physiotherapy. Patients with advanced cancers should be routinely screened for 
      neurovascular complications and risks. Prophylactic therapy should be started 
      wherever warranted.

AB  - Today, teaching and learning paths increasingly intersect with technologies 
      powered by emerging artificial intelligence (AI).This work analyses public 
      opinions and sentiments about AI applications that affect e-learning, such as 
      ChatGPT, virtual and augmented reality, microlearning, mobile learning, adaptive 
      learning, and gamification. The way people perceive technologies fuelled by 
      artificial intelligence can be tracked in real time in microblog messages 
      promptly shared by Twitter users, who currently constitute a large and 
      ever-increasing number of individuals. The observation period was from November 
      30, 2022, the date on which ChatGPT was launched, to March 31, 2023. A two-step 
      sentiment analysis was performed on the collected English-language tweets to 
      determine the overall sentiments and emotions. A latent Dirichlet allocation 
      model was built to identify commonly discussed topics in tweets. The results show 
      that the majority of opinions are positive. Among the eight emotions of the 
      Syuzhet package, 'trust' and 'joy' are the most common positive emotions observed 
      in the tweets, while 'fear' is the most common negative emotion. Among the most 
      discussed topics with a negative outlook, two particular aspects of fear are 
      identified: an 'apocalyptic-fear' that artificial intelligence could lead the end 
      of humankind, and a fear for the 'future of artistic and intellectual jobs' as AI 
      could not only destroy human art and creativity but also make the individual 
      contributions of students and researchers not assessable. On the other hand, 
      among the topics with a positive outlook, trust and hope in AI tools for 
      improving efficiency in jobs and the educational world are identified. Overall, 
      the results suggest that AI will play a significant role in the future of the 
      world and education, but it is important to consider the potential ethical and 
      social implications of this technology. By leveraging the positive aspects of AI 
      while addressing these concerns, the education system can unlock the full 
      potential of this emerging technology and provide a better learning experience 
      for students.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a transformative 
      technology with potential applications in various plastic surgery procedures and 
      plastic surgery education. This article examines the views of plastic surgeons 
      and residents on the role of AI in the field of plastic surgery. METHODS: A 
      34-question survey on AI's role in plastic surgery was distributed to 564 plastic 
      surgeons worldwide, and we received responses from 153 (26.77%) with the majority 
      from Latin America. The survey explored various aspects such as current AI 
      experience, attitudes toward AI, data sources, ethical considerations, and future 
      prospects of AI in plastic surgery and education. Predictions from AI using 
      ChatGPT for each question were compared with the actual survey responses. 
      RESULTS: The study found that most participants had little or no prior AI 
      experience. Although some believed AI could enhance accuracy and visualization, 
      opinions on its impact on surgical time, patient recovery, and satisfaction were 
      mixed. Concerns included patient privacy, data security, costs, and informed 
      consent. Valuable AI training data sources were identified, and there was 
      agreement on the importance of standards and transparency. Respondents expected 
      AI's increasing role in reconstructive and aesthetic surgery, suggesting its 
      integration into residency programs, addressing administrative challenges, and 
      patient complications. Confidence in the enduring importance of human 
      professionals was expressed, with interest in further AI research. CONCLUSION: 
      The survey's findings underscore the need to harness AI's potential while 
      preserving human professionals' roles through informed consent, standardization, 
      and AI education in plastic surgery.

TI  - Are artificial intelligence large language models a reliable tool for difficult 
      differential diagnosis? An a posteriori analysis of a peculiar case of 
      necrotizing otitis externa.
PG  - e7933
LID - 10.1002/ccr3.7933 [doi]
LID - e7933
AB  - KEY CLINICAL MESSAGE: Large language models have made artificial intelligence 
      readily available to the general public and potentially have a role in 
      healthcare; however, their use in difficult differential diagnosis is still 
      limited, as demonstrated by a case of necrotizing otitis externa. ABSTRACT: This 
      case report presents a peculiar case of necrotizing otitis externa (NOE) with 
      skull base involvement which proved diagnostically challenging. The initial 
      patient presentation and the imaging performed on the 78-year-old patient 
      suggested a neoplastic rhinopharyngeal lesion and only after several unsuccessful 
      biopsies the patient was transferred to our unit. Upon re-evaluation of the 
      clinical picture, a clinical hypothesis of NOE with skull base erosion was made 
      and confirmed by identifying Pseudomonas aeruginosa in biopsy specimens of skull 
      base bone and external auditory canal skin. Upon diagnosis confirmation, the 
      patient was treated with culture-oriented long-term antibiotics with complete 
      resolution of the disease. Given the complex clinical presentation, we chose to 
      submit a posteriori this NOE case to two large language models (LLM) to test 
      their ability to handle difficult differential diagnoses. LLMs are easily 
      approachable artificial intelligence tools that enable human-like interaction 
      with the user relying upon large information databases for analyzing queries. The 
      LLMs of choice were ChatGPT-3 and ChatGPT-4 and they were requested to analyze 
      the case being provided with only objective clinical and imaging data.

AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the medical 
      field, as advanced tools powered by large language models (LLMs) make their way 
      into clinical practice, research, and education. Chatbots, which can generate 
      human-like responses, have gained attention for their potential applications. 
      Therefore, familiarity with LLMs and other promising generative AI tools is 
      crucial to harness their potential safely and effectively. As these AI-based 
      technologies continue to evolve, medical professionals must develop a strong 
      understanding of AI terminologies and concepts, particularly generative AI, to 
      effectively tackle real-world challenges and create solutions. This knowledge 
      will enable healthcare professionals to utilize AI-driven innovations for 
      improved patient care and increased productivity in the future. In this brief 
      technical report, we explore 20 of the most relevant terminology associated with 
      the underlying technology behind LLMs and generative AI as they relate to the 
      medical field and provide some examples of how these topics relate to healthcare 
      applications to help in their understanding.

TI  - Comparing the performance of ChatGPT GPT-4, Bard, and Llama-2 in the Taiwan 
      Psychiatric Licensing Examination and in differential diagnosis with multi-center 
      psychiatrists.
LID - 10.1111/pcn.13656 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Large language models (LLMs) have been suggested to play a role in medical 
      education and medical practice. However, the potential of their application in 
      the psychiatric domain has not been well-studied. METHOD: In the first step, we 
      compared the performance of ChatGPT GPT-4, Bard, and Llama-2 in the 2022 Taiwan 
      Psychiatric Licensing Examination conducted in traditional Mandarin. In the 
      second step, we compared the scores of these three LLMs with those of 24 
      experienced psychiatrists in 10 advanced clinical scenario questions designed for 
      psychiatric differential diagnosis. RESULT: Only GPT-4 passed the 2022 Taiwan 
      Psychiatric Licensing Examination (scoring 69 and ≥ 60 being considered a passing 
      grade), while Bard scored 36 and Llama-2 scored 25. GPT-4 outperformed Bard and 
      Llama-2, especially in the areas of 'Pathophysiology &amp; Epidemiology' (χ(2) 
       = 22.4, P &lt; 0.001) and 'Psychopharmacology &amp; Other therapies' (χ(2)  = 15.8, 
      P &lt; 0.001). In the differential diagnosis, the mean score of the 24 experienced 
      psychiatrists (mean 6.1, standard deviation 1.9) was higher than that of GPT-4 
      (5), Bard (3), and Llama-2 (1). CONCLUSION: Compared to Bard and Llama-2, GPT-4 
      demonstrated superior abilities in identifying psychiatric symptoms and making 
      clinical judgments. Besides, GPT-4's ability for differential diagnosis closely 
      approached that of the experienced psychiatrists. GPT-4 revealed a promising 
      potential as a valuable tool in psychiatric practice among the three LLMs.

TI  - Accuracy and Readability of Kidney Stone Patient Information Materials Generated 
      by a Large Language Model Compared to Official Urologic Organizations.
LID - S0090-4295(24)00099-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.urology.2023.11.042 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the readability and accuracy of large language model 
      generated patient information materials (PIMs) to those supplied by the American 
      Urological Association (AUA), Canadian Urological Association (CUA), and European 
      Association of Urology (EAU) for kidney stones. METHODS: PIMs from AUA, CUA, and 
      EAU related to nephrolithiasis were obtained and categorized. The most frequent 
      patient questions related to kidney stones were identified from an internet query 
      and input into GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. PIMs and ChatGPT outputs were assessed for 
      accuracy and readability using previously published indexes. We also assessed 
      changes in ChatGPT outputs when a reading level was specified (grade 6). RESULTS: 
      Readability scores were better for PIMs from the CUA (grade level 10-12), AUA 
      (8-10), or EAU (9-11) compared to the chatbot. GPT-3.5 had the worst readability 
      scores at grade 13-14 and GPT-4 was likewise less readable than urologic 
      organization PIMs with scores of 11-13. While organizational PIMs were deemed to 
      be accurate, the chatbot had high accuracy with minor details omitted. GPT-4 was 
      more accurate in general stone information, dietary and medical management of 
      kidney stones topics in comparison to GPT-3.5, while both models had the same 
      accuracy in the surgical management of nephrolithiasis topics. CONCLUSION: 
      Current PIMs from major urologic organizations for kidney stones remain more 
      readable than publicly available GPT outputs, but they are still higher than the 
      reading ability of the general population. Of the available PIMs for kidney 
      stones, those from the AUA are the most readable. Although Chatbot outputs for 
      common kidney stone patient queries have a high degree of accuracy with minor 
      omitted details, it is important for clinicians to understand their strengths and 
      limitations.

TI  - Artificial intelligence compared with human-derived patient educational materials 
      on cirrhosis.
LID - 10.1097/HC9.0000000000000367 [doi]
LID - e0367
AB  - BACKGROUND: The study compared the readability, grade level, understandability, 
      actionability, and accuracy of standard patient educational material against 
      artificial intelligence chatbot-derived patient educational material regarding 
      cirrhosis. METHODS: An identical standardized phrase was used to generate patient 
      educational materials on cirrhosis from 4 large language model-derived chatbots 
      (ChatGPT, DocsGPT, Google Bard, and Bing Chat), and the outputs were compared 
      against a pre-existing human-derived educational material (Epic). Objective 
      scores for readability and grade level were determined using Flesch-Kincaid and 
      Simple Measure of Gobbledygook scoring systems. 14 patients/caregivers and 8 
      transplant hepatologists were blinded and independently scored the materials on 
      understandability and actionability and indicated whether they believed the 
      material was human or artificial intelligence-generated. Understandability and 
      actionability were determined using the Patient Education Materials Assessment 
      Tool for Printable Materials. Transplant hepatologists also provided medical 
      accuracy scores. RESULTS: Most educational materials scored similarly in 
      readability and grade level but were above the desired sixth-grade reading level. 
      All educational materials were deemed understandable by both groups, while only 
      the human-derived educational material (Epic) was considered actionable by both 
      groups. No significant difference in perceived actionability or understandability 
      among the educational materials was identified. Both groups poorly identified 
      which materials were human-derived versus artificial intelligence-derived. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Chatbot-derived patient educational materials have comparable 
      readability, grade level, understandability, and accuracy to human-derived 
      materials. Readability, grade level, and actionability may be appropriate targets 
      for improvement across educational materials on cirrhosis. Chatbot-derived 
      patient educational materials show promise, and further studies should assess 
      their usefulness in clinical practice.

AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the accuracy of Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer 
      (ChatGPT) powered by GPT-4 in histopathological image detection and 
      classification of colorectal adenomas using the diagnostic consensus provided by 
      pathologists as a reference standard. METHODS: A study was conducted with 100 
      colorectal polyp photomicrographs, comprising an equal number of adenomas and 
      non-adenomas, classified by two pathologists. These images were analysed by 
      classic GPT-4 for 1 time in October 2023 and custom GPT-4 for 20 times in 
      December 2023. GPT-4's responses were compared against the reference standard 
      through statistical measures to evaluate its proficiency in histopathological 
      diagnosis, with the pathologists further assessing the model's descriptive 
      accuracy. RESULTS: GPT-4 demonstrated a median sensitivity of 74% and specificity 
      of 36% for adenoma detection. The median accuracy of polyp classification varied, 
      ranging from 16% for non-specific changes to 36% for tubular adenomas. Its 
      diagnostic consistency, indicated by low kappa values ranging from 0.06 to 0.11, 
      suggested only poor to slight agreement. All of the microscopic descriptions 
      corresponded with their diagnoses. GPT-4 also commented about the limitations in 
      its diagnoses (eg, slide diagnosis best done by pathologists, the inadequacy of 
      single-image diagnostic conclusions, the need for clinical data and a higher 
      magnification view). CONCLUSIONS: GPT-4 showed high sensitivity but low 
      specificity in detecting adenomas and varied accuracy for polyp classification. 
      However, its diagnostic consistency was low. This artificial intelligence tool 
      acknowledged its diagnostic limitations, emphasising the need for a pathologist's 
      expertise and additional clinical context.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the potential use of artificial intelligence language 
      models in formulating rehabilitation prescriptions and International 
      Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) codes.&nbsp; Design: 
      Comparative study based on a single case report compared to standard answers from 
      a textbook. SUBJECTS: A stroke case from textbook.&nbsp; Methods: Chat Generative 
      Pre-Trained Transformer-4 (ChatGPT-4)was used to generate comprehensive medical 
      and rehabilitation prescription information and ICF codes pertaining to the 
      stroke case. This information was compared with standard answers from textbook, 
      and 2 licensed Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PMR) clinicians reviewed the 
      artificial intelligence recommendations for further discussion. RESULTS: 
      ChatGPT-4 effectively formulated rehabilitation prescriptions and ICF codes for a 
      typical stroke case, together with a rationale to support its recommendations. 
      This information was generated in seconds. Compared with standard answers, the 
      large language model generated broader and more general prescriptions in terms of 
      medical problems and management plans, rehabilitation problems and management 
      plans, as well as rehabilitation goals. It also demonstrated the ability to 
      propose specified approaches for each rehabilitation therapy. The language model 
      made an error regarding the ICF&nbsp;category for the stroke case, but no mistakes 
      were identified in the ICF codes assigned.&nbsp; Conclusion: This test case suggests 
      that artificial intelligence language models have potential use in facilitating 
      clinical practice and education in the field of rehabilitation medicine.

      and pitfalls.
PG  - 776-783
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocad252 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To provide balanced consideration of the opportunities and challenges 
      associated with integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) throughout the medical 
      school continuum. PROCESS: Narrative review of published literature 
      contextualized by current reports of LLM application in medical education. 
      CONCLUSIONS: LLMs like OpenAI's ChatGPT can potentially revolutionize traditional 
      teaching methodologies. LLMs offer several potential advantages to students, 
      including direct access to vast information, facilitation of personalized 
      learning experiences, and enhancement of clinical skills development. For faculty 
      and instructors, LLMs can facilitate innovative approaches to teaching complex 
      medical concepts and fostering student engagement. Notable challenges of LLMs 
      integration include the risk of fostering academic misconduct, inadvertent 
      overreliance on AI, potential dilution of critical thinking skills, concerns 
      regarding the accuracy and reliability of LLM-generated content, and the possible 
      implications on teaching staff.

TI  - Performance of artificial intelligence chatbots in sleep medicine certification 
      board exams: ChatGPT versus Google Bard.
PG  - 2137-2143
LID - 10.1007/s00405-023-08381-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To conduct a comparative performance evaluation of GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and 
      Google Bard in self-assessment questions at the level of the American Sleep 
      Medicine Certification Board Exam. METHODS: A total of 301 text-based 
      single-best-answer multiple choice questions with four answer options each, 
      across 10 categories, were included in the study and transcribed as inputs for 
      GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and Google Bard. The first output responses generated were 
      selected and matched for answer accuracy against the gold-standard answer 
      provided by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine for each question. A global 
      score of 80% and above is required by human sleep medicine specialists to pass 
      each exam category. RESULTS: GPT-4 successfully achieved the pass mark of 80% or 
      above in five of the 10 exam categories, including the Normal Sleep and Variants 
      Self-Assessment Exam (2021), Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders 
      Self-Assessment Exam (2021), Insomnia Self-Assessment Exam (2022), Parasomnias 
      Self-Assessment Exam (2022) and the Sleep-Related Movements Self-Assessment Exam 
      (2023). GPT-4 demonstrated superior performance in all exam categories and 
      achieved a higher overall score of 68.1% when compared against both GPT-3.5 
      (46.8%) and Google Bard (45.5%), which was statistically significant (p 
      value &lt; 0.001). There was no significant difference in the overall score 
      performance between GPT-3.5 and Google Bard. CONCLUSIONS: Otolaryngologists and 
      sleep medicine physicians have a crucial role through agile and robust research 
      to ensure the next generation AI chatbots are built safely and responsibly.

      Nurses.
PG  - 59-71

AB  - Hospital librarians receive invites to teach thinking and searching in an 
      evidence-based way and critical appraisal of the literature to nurses. With these 
      invitations, the hospital librarians play a central role in establishing an 
      evidence-based culture in the hospital and contribute to the nursing staff 
      feeling competent and confident in fulfilling evidence-based competencies. This 
      author just prepared a 17-minute online talk as part of an international nursing 
      webinar on "searching nursing literature in an evidence-based way." Using this 
      experience, remembering other teaching and presentation experiences, and some 
      "help" from AI tools, this experienced hospital librarian suggests decision 
      points for colleagues to create a meaningful, practical information session for 
      nurses and introduce to some AI tools along the way.

TI  - Ethical use of Artificial Intelligence in Health Professions Education: AMEE 
      Guide No. 158.
PG  - 574-584
LID - 10.1080/0142159X.2023.2186203 [doi]
AB  - Health Professions Education (HPE) has benefitted from the advances in Artificial 
      Intelligence (AI) and is set to benefit more in the future. Just as any 
      technological advance opens discussions about ethics, so the implications of AI 
      for HPE ethics need to be identified, anticipated, and accommodated so that HPE 
      can utilise AI without compromising crucial ethical principles. Rather than 
      focussing on AI technology, this Guide focuses on the ethical issues likely to 
      face HPE teachers and administrators as they encounter and use AI systems in 
      their teaching environment. While many of the ethical principles may be familiar 
      to readers in other contexts, they will be viewed in light of AI, and some 
      unfamiliar issues will be introduced. They include data gathering, anonymity, 
      privacy, consent, data ownership, security, bias, transparency, responsibility, 
      autonomy, and beneficence. In the Guide, each topic explains the concept and its 
      importance and gives some indication of how to cope with its complexities. Ideas 
      are drawn from personal experience and the relevant literature. In most topics, 
      further reading is suggested so that readers may further explore the concepts at 
      their leisure. The aim is for HPE teachers and decision-makers at all levels to 
      be alert to these issues and to take proactive action to be prepared to deal with 
      the ethical problems and opportunities that AI usage presents to HPE.

      insights that can assist in clinical decision making. Some of these tools have 
      extremely promising initial results, earning both great excitement and creating 
      hype. This non-technical article reviews recent developments in ML/AI in epilepsy 
      to assist the current practicing epileptologist in understanding both the 
      benefits and limitations of integrating ML/AI tools into their clinical practice. 
      RECENT FINDINGS: ML/AI tools have been developed to assist clinicians in almost 
      every clinical decision including (1) predicting future epilepsy in people at 
      risk, (2) detecting and monitoring for seizures, (3) differentiating epilepsy 
      from mimics, (4) using data to improve neuroanatomic localization and 
      lateralization, and (5) tracking and predicting response to medical and surgical 
      treatments. We also discuss practical, ethical, and equity considerations in the 
      development and application of ML/AI tools including chatbots based on Large 
      Language Models (e.g., ChatGPT). ML/AI tools will change how clinical medicine is 
      practiced, but, with rare exceptions, the transferability to other centers, 
      effectiveness, and safety of these approaches have not yet been established 
      rigorously. In the future, ML/AI will not replace epileptologists, but 
      epileptologists with ML/AI will replace epileptologists without ML/AI.

TI  - Challenging ChatGPT 3.5 in Senology-An Assessment of Concordance with Breast 
      Cancer Tumor Board Decision Making.
LID - 10.3390/jpm13101502 [doi]
LID - 1502
AB  - With the recent diffusion of access to publicly available large language models 
      (LLMs), common interest in generative artificial-intelligence-based applications 
      for medical purposes has skyrocketed. The increased use of these models by 
      tech-savvy patients for personal health issues calls for a scientific evaluation 
      of whether LLMs provide a satisfactory level of accuracy for treatment decisions. 
      This observational study compares the concordance of treatment recommendations 
      from the popular LLM ChatGPT 3.5 with those of a multidisciplinary tumor board 
      for breast cancer (MTB). The study design builds on previous findings by 
      combining an extended input model with patient profiles reflecting patho- and 
      immunomorphological diversity of primary breast cancer, including primary 
      metastasis and precancerous tumor stages. Overall concordance between the LLM and 
      MTB is reached for half of the patient profiles, including precancerous lesions. 
      In the assessment of invasive breast cancer profiles, the concordance amounts to 
      58.8%. Nevertheless, as the LLM makes considerably fraudulent decisions at times, 
      we do not identify the current development status of publicly available LLMs to 
      be adequate as a support tool for tumor boards. Gynecological oncologists should 
      familiarize themselves with the capabilities of LLMs in order to understand and 
      utilize their potential while keeping in mind potential risks and limitations.

TI  - The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Surgery: What do General Surgery Residents 
      Think?
PG  - 541-549
LID - 10.1177/00031348231209524 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds significant potential in medical 
      education and patient care, but its rapid emergence presents ethical and 
      practical challenges. This study explored the perspectives of surgical residents 
      on AI's role in medicine. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study surveying 
      general surgery residents at a university-affiliated teaching hospital about 
      their views on AI in medicine and surgical training. The survey covered 
      demographics, residents' understanding of AI, its integration into medical 
      practice, and use of AI tools like ChatGPT. The survey design was inspired by a 
      recent national survey and underwent pretesting before deployment. RESULTS: Of 
      the 31 participants surveyed, 24% identified diagnostics as AI's top application, 
      12% favored its use in identifying anatomical structures in surgeries, and 20% 
      endorsed AI integration into EMRs for predictive models. Attitudes toward AI 
      varied based on its intended application: 77.41% expressed concern about AI 
      making life decisions and 70.97% felt excited about its application for 
      repetitive tasks. A significant 67.74% believed AI could enhance the 
      understanding of medical knowledge. Perception of AI integration varied with AI 
      familiarity (P = .01), with more knowledgeable respondents expressing more 
      positivity. Moreover, familiarity influenced the perceived academic use of 
      ChatGPT (P = .039) and attitudes toward AI in operating rooms (P = .032). 
      Conclusion: This study provides insights into surgery residents' perceptions of 
      AI in medical practice and training. These findings can inform future research, 
      shape policy decisions, and guide AI development, promoting a harmonious 
      collaboration between AI and surgeons to improve both training and patient care.

TI  - Exploring Diagnostic Precision and Triage Proficiency: A Comparative Study of 
      GPT-4 and Bard in Addressing Common Ophthalmic Complaints.
LID - 10.3390/bioengineering11020120 [doi]
LID - 120
AB  - In the modern era, patients often resort to the internet for answers to their 
      health-related concerns, and clinics face challenges to providing timely response 
      to patient concerns. This has led to a need to investigate the capabilities of AI 
      chatbots for ophthalmic diagnosis and triage. In this in silico study, 80 
      simulated patient complaints in ophthalmology with varying urgency levels and 
      clinical descriptors were entered into both ChatGPT and Bard in a systematic 
      3-step submission process asking chatbots to triage, diagnose, and evaluate 
      urgency. Three ophthalmologists graded chatbot responses. Chatbots were 
      significantly better at ophthalmic triage than diagnosis (90.0% appropriate 
      triage vs. 48.8% correct leading diagnosis; p &lt; 0.001), and GPT-4 performed 
      better than Bard for appropriate triage recommendations (96.3% vs. 83.8%; p = 
      0.008), grader satisfaction for patient use (81.3% vs. 55.0%; p &lt; 0.001), and 
      lower potential harm rates (6.3% vs. 20.0%; p = 0.010). More descriptors improved 
      the accuracy of diagnosis for both GPT-4 and Bard. These results indicate that 
      chatbots may not need to recognize the correct diagnosis to provide appropriate 
      ophthalmic triage, and there is a potential utility of these tools in aiding 
      patients or triage staff; however, they are not a replacement for professional 
      ophthalmic evaluation or advice.

TI  - Blockchain Technology Predictions 2024: Transformations in Healthcare, Patient 
      Identity, and Public Health.
LID - 10.30953/bhty.v6.287 [doi]
AB  - In an era characterized by the convergence of cutting-edge technologies, the 
      world of healthcare and public health is on the brink of a profound 
      transformation that will shape the future of medicine and wellness. This 
      transformation is not merely an incremental step forward but a paradigm shift 
      driven by the synergistic integration of digital twins, blockchain technology, 
      artificial intelligence, and multi-omics platforms collectively propelling us 
      into uncharted territory. Integrating these innovations holds the potential to 
      rewrite the rules of engagement in clinical trials, revamp the strategies for 
      preventing public health crises, and redefine how we manage, share, and secure 
      healthcare data. As we embark on this journey of exploration and innovation, we 
      find ourselves at a pivotal juncture, akin to the invention of the microscope in 
      biology or the discovery of antibiotics in medicine. We are at the crossroads of 
      a new era with immense promise and transformative power.

LID - 1209761
AB  - This paper aims to address the divergences and contradictions in the definition 
      of intelligence across different areas of knowledge, particularly in 
      computational intelligence and psychology, where the concept is of significant 
      interest. Despite the differences in motivation and approach, both fields have 
      contributed to the rise of cognitive science. However, the lack of a standardized 
      definition, empirical evidence, or measurement strategy for intelligence is a 
      hindrance to cross-fertilization between these areas, particularly for 
      semantic-based applications. This paper seeks to equalize the definitions of 
      intelligence from the perspectives of computational intelligence and psychology, 
      and offer an overview of the methods used to measure intelligence. We argue that 
      there is no consensus for intelligence, and the term is interchangeably used with 
      similar, opposed, or even contradictory definitions in many fields. This paper 
      concludes with a summary of its central considerations and contributions, where 
      we state intelligence is an agent's ability to process external and internal 
      information to find an optimum adaptation (decision-making) to the environment 
      according to its ontology and then decode this information as an output action.

LID - e37034
AB  - Intraductal papillomas are tumors that arise in the epithelial cells of the 
      mammary duct. Common presenting symptoms for intraductal papilloma include serous 
      or serosanguinous nipple discharge or a palpable mass. We present a case of a 
      48-year-old woman who presented with spontaneous right breast nipple discharge 
      and a palpable mass. Diagnostic imaging for the patient included mammography and 
      ultrasound with color doppler imaging&nbsp;that revealed a mass at eight o'clock in 
      the right breast at a distance of 2 cm from the nipple and that corresponded to 
      the area of&nbsp;palpable concern. Percutaneous ultrasound-guided biopsy of the mass 
      confirmed a diagnosis of intraductal papilloma. Surgical excision may be required 
      in many cases of an intraductal papilloma due to the variety of diagnoses that 
      can be included on the differential, the increased risk for cellular atypia, and 
      the treatment for spontaneous nipple discharge.

TI  - Acute Pneumonia Like Illness and Sepsis in India: Is it Time to Suspect Pulmonary 
      Melioidosis?
PG  - e36122
LID - 10.7759/cureus.36122 [doi]
LID - e36122
AB  - This article describes a case of melioidosis, a severe and potentially fatal 
      disease caused by the Gram-negative bacillus&nbsp;Burkholderia pseudomallei, in a 
      55-year-old female in India. The disease is endemic in Southeast Asia and 
      Northern Australia. Recently there has been an increased number of cases reported 
      in India. The source of&nbsp;B. pseudomallei&nbsp;in India is thought to be soil and water, 
      with the most common mode of infection being through skin contact. The clinical 
      presentation of melioidosis in India varies greatly, making diagnosis difficult. 
      The case presented here with a history of acute febrile illness and progressive 
      dyspnoea, with clinical worsening leading to intensive care unit (ICU) care. We 
      managed this acute pneumonia-like melioidosis with antibiotics and supportive 
      care which showed rapid recovery at follow-up. This case highlights the need for 
      a high index of suspicion and increased awareness of early diagnosis of 
      melioidosis in the Indian subcontinent to improve the patient.

AB  - Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) are powerful language models that have 
      great potential to transform biomedical research. However, they are known to 
      suffer from artificial hallucinations and provide false answers that are 
      seemingly correct in some situations. We developed GeneTuring, a comprehensive QA 
      database with 600 questions in genomics, and manually scored 10,800 answers 
      returned by six GPT models, including GPT-3, ChatGPT, and New Bing. New Bing has 
      the best overall performance and significantly reduces the level of AI 
      hallucination compared to other models, thanks to its ability to recognize its 
      incapacity in answering questions. We argue that improving incapacity awareness 
      is equally important as improving model accuracy to address AI hallucination.

AB  - With the advent of large language models (LLMs), the artificial intelligence 
      revolution in medicine and radiology is now more tangible than ever. Every day, 
      an increasingly large number of articles are published that utilize LLMs in 
      radiology. To adopt and safely implement this new technology in the field, 
      radiologists should be familiar with its key concepts, understand at least the 
      technical basics, and be aware of the potential risks and ethical considerations 
      that come with it. In this review article, the authors provide an overview of the 
      LLMs that might be relevant to the radiology community and include a brief 
      discussion of their short history, technical basics, ChatGPT, prompt engineering, 
      potential applications in medicine and radiology, advantages, disadvantages and 
      risks, ethical and regulatory considerations, and future directions.

AB  - This report describes the diagnosis and treatment of a patient with a rare fungal 
      infection of the external ear, as well as a review of the literature. A 
      76-year-old Caucasian gentleman from rural southern United States with diabetes 
      and hypertension was referred to our clinic for intractable left otalgia, 
      otorrhea, headaches, and an exophytic lesion in the left external ear since five 
      months. There was no pertinent travel history. Biopsy by an outside 
      otolaryngologist was inconclusive. Repeat biopsy under anesthesia revealed 
      morphological characteristics consistent with histoplasmosis. Intravenous 
      amphotericin B and later oral antifungal agent voriconazole led to improvement in 
      symptoms. The clinical presentation resembled a malignancy. A high index of 
      clinical suspicion, histologic confirmation with deep tissue biopsy, and culture 
      are essential for diagnostic confirmation followed by treatment with systemic 
      antifungals. A multidisciplinary team approach is necessary to manage this rare 
      condition.

AB  - A pacemaker is a medical device commonly used to regulate a patient's heartbeat 
      in cases where the heart's natural electrical impulses may be erratic or 
      compromised. Failure of a pacemaker, or pacemaker malfunction, can be 
      life-threatening and requires immediate action to prevent serious 
      complications.&nbsp;This case report describes a 75-year-old male patient with a 
      history of ventricular tachycardia, congestive heart failure, hypertension, and 
      smoking who was admitted to the hospital with symptoms of palpitations, 
      dizziness, lightheadedness, and decreased level of alertness. The patient had a 
      single-chamber pacemaker implanted two years prior to the current admission. Upon 
      physical examination, the patient's pacemaker had failed, and he was diagnosed 
      with pacemaker failure. Differential diagnoses were ranked from most likely to 
      least likely, based on the patient's history and physical examination, and 
      included pacemaker failure, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, and pulmonary 
      embolism. Treatment included the replacement of the pacemaker, and the patient 
      was discharged in stable condition.

TI  - A Comparative Study of Large Language Models, Human Experts, and Expert-Edited 
      Large Language Models to Neuro-Ophthalmology Questions.
LID - 10.1097/WNO.0000000000002145 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in medicine, 
      their effectiveness compared with human experts remains unclear. This study 
      evaluates the quality and empathy of Expert + AI, human experts, and LLM 
      responses in neuro-ophthalmology. METHODS: This randomized, masked, multicenter 
      cross-sectional study was conducted from June to July 2023. We randomly assigned 
      21 neuro-ophthalmology questions to 13 experts. Each expert provided an answer 
      and then edited a ChatGPT-4-generated response, timing both tasks. In addition, 5 
      LLMs (ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, Claude 2, Bing, Bard) generated responses. 
      Anonymized and randomized responses from Expert + AI, human experts, and LLMs 
      were evaluated by the remaining 12 experts. The main outcome was the mean score 
      for quality and empathy, rated on a 1-5 scale. RESULTS: Significant differences 
      existed between response types for both quality and empathy (P &lt; 0.0001, P &lt; 
      0.0001). For quality, Expert + AI (4.16 ± 0.81) performed the best, followed by 
      GPT-4 (4.04 ± 0.92), GPT-3.5 (3.99 ± 0.87), Claude (3.6 ± 1.09), Expert (3.56 ± 
      1.01), Bard (3.5 ± 1.15), and Bing (3.04 ± 1.12). For empathy, Expert + AI (3.63 
      ± 0.87) had the highest score, followed by GPT-4 (3.6 ± 0.88), Bard (3.54 ± 
      0.89), GPT-3.5 (3.5 ± 0.83), Bing (3.27 ± 1.03), Expert (3.26 ± 1.08), and Claude 
      (3.11 ± 0.78). For quality (P &lt; 0.0001) and empathy (P = 0.002), Expert + AI 
      performed better than Expert. Time taken for expert-created and expert-edited LLM 
      responses was similar (P = 0.75). CONCLUSIONS: Expert-edited LLM responses had 
      the highest expert-determined ratings of quality and empathy warranting further 
      exploration of their potential benefits in clinical settings.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence in Medical Education: Comparative Analysis of ChatGPT, 
      Bing, and Medical Students in Germany.
PG  - e46482
LID - 10.2196/46482 [doi]
LID - e46482
AB  - BACKGROUND: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential 
      in diverse domains, including medicine. Nonetheless, there is a scarcity of 
      studies examining their performance in medical examinations, especially those 
      conducted in languages other than English, and in direct comparison with medical 
      students. Analyzing the performance of LLMs in state medical examinations can 
      provide insights into their capabilities and limitations and evaluate their 
      potential role in medical education and examination preparation. OBJECTIVE: This 
      study aimed to assess and compare the performance of 3 LLMs, GPT-4, Bing, and 
      GPT-3.5-Turbo, in the German Medical State Examinations of 2022 and to evaluate 
      their performance relative to that of medical students. METHODS: The LLMs were 
      assessed on a total of 630 questions from the spring and fall German Medical 
      State Examinations of 2022. The performance was evaluated with and without 
      media-related questions. Statistical analyses included 1-way ANOVA and 
      independent samples t tests for pairwise comparisons. The relative strength of 
      the LLMs in comparison with that of the students was also evaluated. RESULTS: 
      GPT-4 achieved the highest overall performance, correctly answering 88.1% of 
      questions, closely followed by Bing (86.0%) and GPT-3.5-Turbo (65.7%). The 
      students had an average correct answer rate of 74.6%. Both GPT-4 and Bing 
      significantly outperformed the students in both examinations. When media 
      questions were excluded, Bing achieved the highest performance of 90.7%, closely 
      followed by GPT-4 (90.4%), while GPT-3.5-Turbo lagged (68.2%). There was a 
      significant decline in the performance of GPT-4 and Bing in the fall 2022 
      examination, which was attributed to a higher proportion of media-related 
      questions and a potential increase in question difficulty. CONCLUSIONS: LLMs, 
      particularly GPT-4 and Bing, demonstrate potential as valuable tools in medical 
      education and for pretesting examination questions. Their high performance, even 
      relative to that of medical students, indicates promising avenues for further 
      development and integration into the educational and clinical landscape.

TI  - Ventricular Septal Rupture and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Assisted Healthcare.
PG  - e36581
LID - 10.7759/cureus.36581 [doi]
LID - e36581
AB  - This case report highlights the use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) for the 
      diagnosis of ventricular septal rupture (VSR), a severe consequence of acute 
      myocardial infarction (AMI). VSR has a broad spectrum of signs and inconspicuous 
      symptoms, making the diagnosis difficult. POCUS offers non-invasive, real-time 
      cardiac imaging and has an advantage over other methods due to its ability to 
      identify VSR early. Here we present a 63-year-old female with a history of type 2 
      diabetes, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, and a family history of cardiovascular 
      disease, who came to the ED with chest pain for three days, palpitations, and 
      dyspnea at rest. On examination, the patient was hypotensive, tachycardic, and 
      had crackles with a harsh holosystolic murmur. An EKG and elevated troponin 
      levels suggested acute on chronic anterior-lateral wall ST-elevation myocardial 
      infarction (STEMI). Resuscitation efforts were initiated, followed by a lung 
      ultrasound that revealed good lung sliding and multiple B lines without pleural 
      thickening, indicating pulmonary edema. Echocardiography revealed ischemic heart 
      disease with moderate left ventricle (LV) systolic dysfunction and a 14 mm apical 
      ventricular septal rupture (hypokinetic thinning of the anterior wall, septum, 
      apex, and anterolateral wall with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 
      39%). The presence of flow on color Doppler across the interventricular septum, 
      showing left-to-right shunting, led to a definitive diagnosis of acute-on-chronic 
      myocardial infarction (MI) with ventricular septal rupture. The case report also 
      emphasizes how modern AI applications like ChatGPT (OpenAI, San Francisco, 
      California, United States), aid in language and research, saving time and 
      redefining the healthcare and research industry. As a result, we are confident 
      that AI-assisted healthcare will be the next global breakthrough.

TI  - LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS) AND CHATGPT FOR BIOMEDICINE.
PG  - 641-644
AB  - Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence that has been 
      revolutionizing various fields, including biomedicine. They have the capability 
      to process and analyze large amounts of data, understand natural language, and 
      generate new content, making them highly desirable in many biomedical 
      applications and beyond. In this workshop, we aim to introduce the attendees to 
      an in-depth understanding of the rise of LLMs in biomedicine, and how they are 
      being used to drive innovation and improve outcomes in the field, along with 
      associated challenges and pitfalls.

AB  - Operative notes are an essential piece of documentation made by an ophthalmic 
      team following ocular or ophthalmic surgery. While the advanced language 
      processing capabilities of GPT-4 can be utilized to enhance the comprehension of 
      natural language in healthcare applications, the utilization of GPT-4 in writing 
      operative notes is not explicitly referenced in the current literature. In this 
      paper, we describe the potential applications for GPT-4 to write ophthalmic 
      operative notes. It is imperative to acknowledge that despite the impressive 
      capabilities exhibited by GPT-4, it remains constrained by certain limitations, 
      and therefore, ought to be employed in tandem with human expertise and subjected 
      to critical evaluation.

TI  - Rectal Bezoar: A Rare Cause of Intestinal Obstruction.
PG  - e35726
LID - 10.7759/cureus.35726 [doi]
LID - e35726
AB  - Bezoars are conglomerates of undigested contents that accumulate in the 
      gastrointestinal tract. They can have different compositions, such as fibers, 
      seeds, vegetables (phytobezoars), hair (trichobezoars), and medication 
      (pharmacobezoars). Bezoars are typically caused by an impaired grinding mechanism 
      of the stomach or interdigestive migrating motor complex, but the composition of 
      ingested material can also play a role in their formation. Gastric dysmotility, 
      previous gastric surgery, and gastroparesis are some of the risk factors that can 
      increase the likelihood of developing bezoars. While bezoars are usually 
      asymptomatic and found in the stomach, they can sometimes migrate to the small 
      intestine or colon and cause complications such as intestinal obstruction or 
      perforation. Endoscopy is essential for diagnosis and etiology, and treatment 
      depends on the composition, which can include chemical dissolution or surgical 
      intervention. We present a case of an 86-year-old woman, who had a bezoar located 
      in an unusual location (rectum), most likely due to migration. This condition led 
      to symptoms of intermittent intestinal obstruction and rectal bleeding. However, 
      due to anal stenosis, the patient was unable to expel the bezoar. Its removal was 
      not possible through various endoscopic techniques. Therefore, it was removed via 
      fragmentation, using an anoscope and forceps, due to its hard/stone-like 
      consistency.&nbsp;This case highlights the importance of considering bezoars in the 
      differential diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleeding and illustrates the 
      importance of prompt diagnosis and appropriate techniques for the removal of 
      bezoars.

TI  - Medical malpractice liability in large language model artificial intelligence: 
      legal review and policy recommendations.
LID - 10.1515/jom-2023-0229 [doi]
AB  - The emergence of generative large language model (LLM) artificial intelligence 
      (AI) represents one of the most profound developments in healthcare in decades, 
      with the potential to create revolutionary and seismic changes in the practice of 
      medicine as we know it. However, significant concerns have arisen over questions 
      of liability for bad outcomes associated with LLM AI-influenced medical decision 
      making. Although the authors were not able to identify a case in the United 
      States that has been adjudicated on medical malpractice in the context of LLM AI 
      at this time, sufficient precedent exists to interpret how analogous situations 
      might be applied to these cases when they inevitably come to trial in the future. 
      This commentary will discuss areas of potential legal vulnerability for 
      clinicians utilizing LLM AI through review of past case law pertaining to 
      third-party medical guidance and review the patchwork of&nbsp;current regulations 
      relating to medical malpractice liability in AI. Finally, we will propose 
      proactive policy recommendations including creating an enforcement duty at the US 
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to require algorithmic transparency, recommend 
      reliance on peer-reviewed data and rigorous validation testing when LLMs are 
      utilized in clinical settings, and encourage tort reform to share liability 
      between physicians and LLM developers.

TI  - Factors Predicting Intentions of Adoption and Continued Use of Artificial 
      Intelligence Chatbots for Mental Health: Examining the Role of UTAUT Model, 
      Stigma, Privacy Concerns, and Artificial Intelligence Hesitancy.
PG  - 722-730
LID - 10.1089/tmj.2023.0313 [doi]
AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence-based chatbots (AI chatbots) can potentially 
      improve mental health care, yet factors predicting their adoption and continued 
      use are unclear. Methods: We conducted an online survey with a sample of U.S. 
      adults with symptoms of depression and anxiety (N = 393) in 2021 before the 
      release of ChatGPT. We explored factors predicting the adoption and continued use 
      of AI chatbots, including factors of the unified theory of acceptance and use of 
      technology model, stigma, privacy concerns, and AI hesitancy. Results: Results 
      from the regression indicated that for nonusers, performance expectancy, price 
      value, descriptive norm, and psychological distress are positively related to the 
      intention of adopting AI chatbots, while AI hesitancy and effort expectancy are 
      negatively associated with adopting AI chatbots. For those with experience in 
      using AI chatbots for mental health, performance expectancy, price value, 
      descriptive norm, and injunctive norm are positively related to the intention of 
      continuing to use AI chatbots. Conclusions: Understanding the adoption and 
      continued use of AI chatbots among adults with symptoms of depression and anxiety 
      is essential given that there is a widening gap in the supply and demand of care. 
      AI chatbots provide new opportunities for quality care by supporting accessible, 
      affordable, efficient, and personalized care. This study provides insights for 
      developing and deploying AI chatbots such as ChatGPT in the context of mental 
      health care. Findings could be used to design innovative interventions that 
      encourage the adoption and continued use of AI chatbots among people with 
      symptoms of depression and anxiety and who have difficulty accessing care.

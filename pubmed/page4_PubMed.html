TI  - Using ChatGPT in Medical Research: Current Status and Future Directions.
PG  - 1513-1520
LID - 10.2147/JMDH.S413470 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This review aims to evaluate the current evidence on the use of the 
      Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) in medical research, including but 
      not limited to treatment, diagnosis, or medication provision. METHODS: This 
      review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
      Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched Google Scholar, Web of Science, 
      PubMed, and Medline to identify studies published between 2022 and 2023 that 
      aimed to utilize ChatGPT in medical research. All identified references were 
      stored in EndNote. RESULTS: We initially identified 114 articles, out of which 
      six studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for full-text screening. 
      Among the six studies, two focused on drug development (33.33%), two on 
      literature review writing (33.33%), and one each on medical report improvement, 
      provision of medical information, improving research conduct, data analysis, and 
      personalized medicine (16.67% each). CONCLUSION: ChatGPT has the potential to 
      revolutionize medical research in various ways. However, its accuracy, 
      originality, academic integrity, and ethical issues must be thoroughly discussed 
      and improved before its widespread implementation in clinical research and 
      medical practice.

TI  - Are ChatGPT and large language models "the answer" to bringing us closer to 
      systematic review automation?
PG  - 72

AB  - In this commentary, we discuss ChatGPT and our perspectives on its utility to 
      systematic reviews (SRs) through the appropriateness and applicability of its 
      responses to SR related prompts. The advancement of artificial intelligence 
      (AI)-assisted technologies leave many wondering about the current capabilities, 
      limitations, and opportunities for integration AI into scientific endeavors. 
      Large language models (LLM)-such as ChatGPT, designed by OpenAI-have recently 
      gained widespread attention with their ability to respond to various prompts in a 
      natural-sounding way. Systematic reviews (SRs) utilize secondary data and often 
      require many months and substantial financial resources to complete, making them 
      attractive grounds for developing AI-assistive technologies. On February 6, 2023, 
      PICO Portal developers hosted a webinar to explore ChatGPT's responses to tasks 
      related to SR methodology. Our experience from exploring the responses of ChatGPT 
      suggest that while ChatGPT and LLMs show some promise for aiding in SR-related 
      tasks, the technology is in its infancy and needs much development for such 
      applications. Furthermore, we advise that great caution should be taken by 
      non-content experts in using these tools due to much of the output appearing, at 
      a high level, to be valid, while much is erroneous and in need of active vetting.

TI  - What if your patient switches from Dr. Google to Dr. ChatGPT? A vignette-based 
      survey of the trustworthiness, value, and danger of ChatGPT-generated responses 
      to health questions.
PG  - 95-98
LID - 10.1093/eurjcn/zvad038 [doi]
AB  - ChatGPT is a new artificial intelligence system that revolutionizes the way how 
      information can be sought and obtained. In this study, the trustworthiness, 
      value, and danger of ChatGPT-generated responses on four vignettes that 
      represented virtual patient questions were evaluated by 20 experts in the domain 
      of congenital heart disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, or cholesterol. 
      Experts generally considered ChatGPT-generated responses trustworthy and 
      valuable, with few considering them dangerous. Forty percent of the experts found 
      ChatGPT responses more valuable than Google. Experts appreciated the 
      sophistication and nuances in the responses but also recognized that responses 
      were often incomplete and sometimes misleading.

LID - S2468-6530(23)00449-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.oret.2023.09.008 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess large language models in generating readable uveitis 
      information and in improving the readability of online health information. 
      DESIGN: Evaluation of technology. SUBJECTS: Not applicable. METHODS: ChatGPT and 
      Bard were asked the following prompts: (prompt A) "considering that the average 
      American reads at a 6th grade level, using the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL) 
      formula, can you write patient-targeted health information on uveitis of around 
      6th grade level?" and (prompt B) "can you write patient-targeted health 
      information on uveitis that is easy to understand by an average American?" 
      Additionally, ChatGPT and Bard were asked the following prompt from the 
      first-page results of Google when the term "uveitis" was searched: "Considering 
      that the average American reads at a 6th grade level, using the FKGL formula, can 
      you rewrite the following text to 6th grade level: [insert text]." The 
      readability of each response was analyzed and compared using several metrics 
      described below. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The FKGL is a highly validated 
      readability assessment tool that assigns a grade level to a given text, the total 
      number of words, sentences, syllables, and complex words. Complex words were 
      defined as those with &gt; 2 syllables. RESULTS: ChatGPT and Bard generated 
      responses with lower FKGL scores (i.e., easier to understand) in response to 
      prompt A compared with prompt B. This was only significant for ChatGPT (P &lt; 
      0.0001). The mean FKGL of responses to ChatGPT (6.3 Â± 1.2) was significantly 
      lower (P &lt; 0.0001) than Bard 10.5 Â± 0.8. ChatGPT responses also contained less 
      complex words than Bard (P &lt; 0.0001). Online health information on uveitis had a 
      mean grade level of 11.0 Â± 1.4. ChatGPT lowered the FKGL to 8.0 Â± 1.0 (P &lt; 
      0.0001) when asked to rewrite the content. Bard was not able to do so (mean FKGL 
      of 11.1 Â± 1.6). CONCLUSIONS: ChatGPT can aid clinicians in producing 
      easier-to-understand health information on uveitis for patients compared with 
      already-existing content. It can also help with reducing the difficulty of the 
      language used for uveitis health information targeted for patients. FINANCIAL

TI  - Diagnostic and Management Applications of ChatGPT in Structured Otolaryngology 
      Clinical Scenarios.
PG  - e67
LID - 10.1002/oto2.67 [doi]
LID - e67
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical applications and limitations of chat 
      generative pretrained transformer (ChatGPT) in otolaryngology. STUDY DESIGN: 
      Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Tertiary academic center. METHODS: ChatGPT 4.0 
      was queried for diagnoses and management plans for 20 physician-written clinical 
      vignettes in otolaryngology. Attending physicians were then asked to rate the 
      difficulty of the clinical vignettes and agreement with the differential 
      diagnoses and management plans of ChatGPT responses on a 5-point Likert scale. 
      Summary statistics were calculated. Univariate ordinal regression was then 
      performed between vignette difficulty and quality of the diagnoses and management 
      plans. RESULTS: Eleven attending physicians completed the survey (61% response 
      rate). Overall, vignettes were rated as very easy to neutral difficulty (range of 
      median score: 1.00-4.00; overall median 2.00). There was a high agreement with 
      the differential diagnosis provided by ChatGPT (range of median score: 3.00-5.00; 
      overall median: 5.00). There was also high agreement with treatment plans (range 
      of median score: 3.00-5.00; overall median: 5.00). There was no association 
      between vignette difficulty and agreement with differential diagnosis or 
      treatment. Lower diagnosis scores had greater odds of having lower treatment 
      scores. CONCLUSION: Generative artificial intelligence models like ChatGPT are 
      being rapidly adopted in medicine. Performance with curated, easy-to-moderate 
      difficulty otolaryngology scenarios indicate high agreement with physicians for 
      diagnosis and management. However, a decreased quality in diagnosis is associated 
      with decreased quality in management. Further research is necessary on ChatGPT's 
      ability to handle unstructured clinical information.

TI  - Enhancing Triage Efficiency and Accuracy in Emergency Rooms for Patients with 
      Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Retrospective Analysis of Artificial 
      Intelligence-Assisted Triage Using ChatGPT 4.0.
LID - 10.3390/cancers15143717 [doi]
LID - 3717
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate and efficient triage is crucial for prioritizing care and 
      managing resources in emergency rooms. This study investigates the effectiveness 
      of ChatGPT, an advanced artificial intelligence system, in assisting health 
      providers with decision-making for patients presenting with metastatic prostate 
      cancer, focusing on the potential to improve both patient outcomes and resource 
      allocation. METHODS: Clinical data from patients with metastatic prostate cancer 
      who presented to the emergency room between 1 May 2022 and 30 April 2023 were 
      retrospectively collected. The primary outcome was the sensitivity and 
      specificity of ChatGPT in determining whether a patient required admission or 
      discharge. The secondary outcomes included the agreement between ChatGPT and 
      emergency medicine physicians, the comprehensiveness of diagnoses, the accuracy 
      of treatment plans proposed by both parties, and the length of medical decision 
      making. RESULTS: Of the 147 patients screened, 56 met the inclusion criteria. 
      ChatGPT had a sensitivity of 95.7% in determining admission and a specificity of 
      18.2% in discharging patients. In 87.5% of cases, ChatGPT made the same primary 
      diagnoses as physicians, with more accurate terminology use (42.9% vs. 21.4%, p = 
      0.02) and more comprehensive diagnostic lists (median number of diagnoses: 3 vs. 
      2, p &lt; 0.001). Emergency Severity Index scores calculated by ChatGPT were not 
      associated with admission (p = 0.12), hospital stay length (p = 0.91) or ICU 
      admission (p = 0.54). Despite shorter mean word count (169 Â± 66 vs. 272 Â± 105, p 
      &lt; 0.001), ChatGPT was more likely to give additional treatment recommendations 
      than physicians (94.3% vs. 73.5%, p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      hypothesis-generating data demonstrated that ChatGPT is associated with a high 
      sensitivity in determining the admission of patients with metastatic prostate 
      cancer in the emergency room. It also provides accurate and comprehensive 
      diagnoses. These findings suggest that ChatGPT has the potential to assist health 
      providers in improving patient triage in emergency settings, and may enhance both 
      efficiency and quality of care provided by the physicians.

AB  - Background Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT-3.5, Google Bard, and 
      Microsoft Bing, have shown promising capabilities in various natural language 
      processing (NLP) tasks. However, their performance and accuracy in solving 
      domain-specific questions, particularly in the field of hematology, have not been 
      extensively investigated. Objective This study aimed to explore the capability of 
      LLMs, namely, ChatGPT-3.5, Google Bard, and Microsoft Bing (Precise), in solving 
      hematology-related cases and comparing their performance. Methods This was a 
      cross-sectional study conducted in the Department of Physiology and Pathology, 
      All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Deoghar, Jharkhand, India. We curated a 
      set of 50 cases on hematology covering a range of topics and complexities. The 
      dataset included queries related to blood disorders, hematologic malignancies, 
      laboratory test parameters, calculations, and treatment options. Each case and 
      related question was prepared with a set of correct answers to compare with. We 
      utilized ChatGPT-3.5, Google Bard Experiment, and Microsoft Bing (Precise) for 
      question-answering tasks. The answers were checked by two physiologists and one 
      pathologist. They rated the answers on a rating scale from one to five. The 
      average score of the three models was compared by Friedman's test with Dunn's 
      post-hoc test. The performance of the LLMs was compared with a median of 2.5 by a 
      one-sample median test as the curriculum from which the questions were curated 
      has a 50% pass grade. Results The scores among the three LLMs were significantly 
      different (p-value &lt; 0.0001) with the highest score by ChatGPT (3.15Â±1.19), 
      followed by Bard (2.23Â±1.17)&nbsp;and Bing (1.98Â±1.01). The score of ChatGPT was 
      significantly higher than 50% (p-value = 0.0004), Bard's score was close to 50% 
      (p-value = 0.38), and Bing's score was significantly lower than the pass score 
      (p-value = 0.0015). Conclusion The LLMs reveal significant differences in solving 
      case vignettes in hematology. ChatGPT exhibited the highest score, followed by 
      Google Bard and Microsoft Bing. The observed performance trends suggest that 
      ChatGPT holds promising potential in the medical domain. However, none of the 
      models was capable of answering all questions accurately. Further research and 
      optimization of language models can offer valuable contributions to healthcare 
      and medical education applications.

AB  - Background Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools capable of 
      processing and generating human-like text. These LLMs, such as ChatGPT (OpenAI 
      Incorporated, Mission District, San Francisco, United States), Google Bard 
      (Alphabet Inc., CA, US),&nbsp;and Microsoft Bing (Microsoft Corporation, WA, US), have 
      been applied across various domains, demonstrating their potential to assist in 
      solving complex tasks and improving information accessibility. However, their 
      application in solving case&nbsp;vignettes in physiology has not been explored. This 
      study aimed to assess the performance of three LLMs, namely, ChatGPT (3.5; free 
      research version), Google Bard (Experiment), and Microsoft Bing (precise), in 
      answering cases vignettes in Physiology. Methods This cross-sectional study was 
      conducted in July 2023. A total of 77 case vignettes in physiology were prepared 
      by two physiologists and were validated by two other content experts. These cases 
      were presented to each LLM, and their responses were collected. Two physiologists 
      independently rated the answers provided by the LLMs based on their accuracy. The 
      ratings were measured on a scale from 0 to 4 according to the structure of the 
      observed learning outcome (pre-structural = 0, uni-structural = 1, 
      multi-structural = 2, relational = 3, extended-abstract). The scores among the 
      LLMs were compared by Friedman's test and inter-observer agreement was checked by 
      the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results The overall scores for 
      ChatGPT, Bing, and Bard in the study, with a total of 77 cases, were found to be 
      3.19Â±0.3, 2.15Â±0.6, and 2.91Â±0.5, respectively, p&lt;0.0001. Hence, ChatGPT 3.5 
      (free version) obtained the highest score, Bing (Precise) had the lowest score, 
      and Bard (Experiment) fell in between the two in terms of performance. The 
      average ICC values for ChatGPT, Bing, and Bard were 0.858 (95% CI: 0.777 to 0.91, 
      p&lt;0.0001), 0.975 (95% CI: 0.961 to 0.984, p&lt;0.0001), and 0.964 (95% CI: 0.944 to 
      0.977, p&lt;0.0001), respectively. Conclusion ChatGPT outperformed Bard and Bing in 
      answering case vignettes in physiology. Hence, students and teachers may think 
      about choosing LLMs for their educational purposes accordingly for case-based 
      learning in physiology. Further exploration of their capabilities is needed for 
      adopting those in medical education and support for clinical decision-making.

TI  - Performance of the Large Language Model ChatGPT on the National Nurse 
      Examinations in Japan: Evaluation Study.
PG  - e47305
LID - 10.2196/47305 [doi]
LID - e47305
AB  - BACKGROUND: ChatGPT, a large language model, has shown good performance on 
      physician certification examinations and medical consultations. However, its 
      performance has not been examined in languages other than English or on nursing 
      examinations. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT on the 
      Japanese National Nurse Examinations. METHODS: We evaluated the percentages of 
      correct answers provided by ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) for all questions on the Japanese 
      National Nurse Examinations from 2019 to 2023, excluding inappropriate questions 
      and those containing images. Inappropriate questions were pointed out by a 
      third-party organization and announced by the government to be excluded from 
      scoring. Specifically, these include "questions with inappropriate question 
      difficulty" and "questions with errors in the questions or choices." These 
      examinations consist of 240 questions each year, divided into basic knowledge 
      questions that test the basic issues of particular importance to nurses and 
      general questions that test a wide range of specialized knowledge. Furthermore, 
      the questions had 2 types of formats: simple-choice and situation-setup 
      questions. Simple-choice questions are primarily knowledge-based and 
      multiple-choice, whereas situation-setup questions entail the candidate reading a 
      patient's and family situation's description, and selecting the nurse's action or 
      patient's response. Hence, the questions were standardized using 2 types of 
      prompts before requesting answers from ChatGPT. Chi-square tests were conducted 
      to compare the percentage of correct answers for each year's examination format 
      and specialty area related to the question. In addition, a Cochran-Armitage trend 
      test was performed with the percentage of correct answers from 2019 to 2023. 
      RESULTS: The 5-year average percentage of correct answers for ChatGPT was 75.1% 
      (SD 3%) for basic knowledge questions and 64.5% (SD 5%) for general questions. 
      The highest percentage of correct answers on the 2019 examination was 80% for 
      basic knowledge questions and 71.2% for general questions. ChatGPT met the 
      passing criteria for the 2019 Japanese National Nurse Examination and was close 
      to passing the 2020-2023 examinations, with only a few more correct answers 
      required to pass. ChatGPT had a lower percentage of correct answers in some 
      areas, such as pharmacology, social welfare, related law and regulations, 
      endocrinology/metabolism, and dermatology, and a higher percentage of correct 
      answers in the areas of nutrition, pathology, hematology, ophthalmology, 
      otolaryngology, dentistry and dental surgery, and nursing integration and 
      practice. CONCLUSIONS: ChatGPT only passed the 2019 Japanese National Nursing 
      Examination during the most recent 5 years. Although it did not pass the 
      examinations from other years, it performed very close to the passing level, even 
      in those containing questions related to psychology, communication, and nursing.

AB  - The advent of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly ChatGPT/GPT-4, has led 
      to advancements in various fields, including healthcare. This study explores the 
      prospective role of ChatGPT/GPT-4 in various facets of spinal surgical practice, 
      especially in supporting spinal surgeons during the perioperative management of 
      endoscopic spinal surgery for patients with lumbar disc herniation. The AI-driven 
      chatbot can facilitate communication between spinal surgeons, patients, and their 
      relatives, streamline the collection and analysis of patient data, and contribute 
      to the surgical planning process. Furthermore, ChatGPT/GPT-4 may enhance 
      intraoperative support by providing real-time surgical navigation information and 
      physiological parameter monitoring, as well as aiding in postoperative 
      rehabilitation guidance. However, the appropriate and supervised use of 
      ChatGPT/GPT-4 is essential, considering the potential risks associated with data 
      security and privacy. The study concludes that ChatGPT/GPT-4 can serve as a

AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence in the field of orthopaedics has been a topic 
      of increasing interest and opportunity in recent years. Its applications are 
      widespread both for physicians and patients, including use in clinical 
      decision-making, in the operating room, and in research. In this study, we aimed 
      to assess the quality of ChatGPT answers when asked questions related to total 
      knee arthroplasty. METHODS: ChatGPT prompts were created by turning 15 of the 
      American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Clinical Practice Guidelines into 
      questions. An online survey was created, which included screenshots of each 
      prompt and answers to the 15 questions. Surgeons were asked to grade ChatGPT 
      answers from 1 to 5 based on their characteristics: (1) relevance, (2) accuracy, 
      (3) clarity, (4) completeness, (5) evidence-based, and (6) consistency. There 
      were 11 Adult Joint Reconstruction fellowship-trained surgeons who completed the 
      survey. Questions were subclassified based on the subject of the prompt: (1) risk 
      factors, (2) implant/intraoperative, and (3) pain/functional outcomes. The 
      average and standard deviation for all answers, as well as for each subgroup, 
      were calculated. Inter-rater reliability (IRR) was also calculated. RESULTS: All 
      answer characteristics were graded as being above average (ie, a score &gt; 3). 
      Relevance demonstrated the highest scores (4.43 Â± 0.77) by surgeons surveyed, and 
      consistency demonstrated the lowest scores (3.54 Â± 1.10). ChatGPT prompts in the 
      Risk Factors group demonstrated the best responses, while those in the 
      Pain/Functional Outcome group demonstrated the lowest. The overall IRR was found 
      to be 0.33 (poor reliability), with the highest IRR for relevance (0.43) and the 
      lowest for evidence-based (0.28). CONCLUSIONS: ChatGPT can answer questions 
      regarding well-established clinical guidelines in total knee arthroplasty with 
      above-average accuracy but demonstrates variable reliability. This investigation 
      is the first step in understanding large language model artificial intelligence 
      like ChatGPT and how well they perform in the field of arthroplasty.

AB  - BACKGROUND: ChatGPT has substantial potential to revolutionize medical education. 
      We aim to assess how medical students and laypeople evaluate information produced 
      by ChatGPT compared to an evidence-based resource on the diagnosis and management 
      of 5 common surgical conditions. METHODS: A 60-question anonymous online survey 
      was distributed to third- and fourth-year U.S. medical students and laypeople to 
      evaluate articles produced by ChatGPT and an evidence-based source on clarity, 
      relevance, reliability, validity, organization, and comprehensiveness. 
      Participants received 2 blinded articles, 1 from each source, for each surgical 
      condition. Paired-sample t-tests were used to compare ratings between the 2 
      sources. RESULTS: Of 56 survey participants, 50.9% (n = 28) were U.S. medical 
      students and 49.1% (n = 27) were from the general population. Medical students 
      reported that ChatGPT articles displayed significantly more clarity 
      (appendicitis: 4.39 vs 3.89, P = .020; diverticulitis: 4.54 vs 3.68, P &lt; .001; 
      SBO 4.43 vs 3.79, P = .003; GI bleed: 4.36 vs 3.93, P = .020) and better 
      organization (diverticulitis: 4.36 vs 3.68, P = .021; SBO: 4.39 vs 3.82, P = 
      .033) than the evidence-based source. However, for all 5 conditions, medical 
      students found evidence-based passages to be more comprehensive than ChatGPT 
      articles (cholecystitis: 4.04 vs 3.36, P = .009; appendicitis: 4.07 vs 3.36, P = 
      .015; diverticulitis: 4.07 vs 3.36, P = .015; small bowel obstruction: 4.11 vs 
      3.54, P = .030; upper GI bleed: 4.11 vs 3.29, P = .003). CONCLUSION: Medical 
      students perceived ChatGPT articles to be clearer and better organized than 
      evidence-based sources on the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of 5 common 
      surgical pathologies. However, evidence-based articles were rated as 
      significantly more comprehensive.

AB  - BACKGROUND: ChatGPT-4 is the latest release of a novel artificial intelligence 
      (AI) chatbot able to answer freely formulated and complex questions. In the near 
      future, ChatGPT could become the new standard for health care professionals and 
      patients to access medical information. However, little is known about the 
      quality of medical information provided by the AI. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess 
      the reliability of medical information provided by ChatGPT. METHODS: Medical 
      information provided by ChatGPT-4 on the 5 hepato-pancreatico-biliary (HPB) 
      conditions with the highest global disease burden was measured with the Ensuring 
      Quality Information for Patients (EQIP) tool. The EQIP tool is used to measure 
      the quality of internet-available information and consists of 36 items that are 
      divided into 3 subsections. In addition, 5 guideline recommendations per analyzed 
      condition were rephrased as questions and input to ChatGPT, and agreement between 
      the guidelines and the AI answer was measured by 2 authors independently. All 
      queries were repeated 3 times to measure the internal consistency of ChatGPT. 
      RESULTS: Five conditions were identified (gallstone disease, pancreatitis, liver 
      cirrhosis, pancreatic cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma). The median EQIP 
      score across all conditions was 16 (IQR 14.5-18) for the total of 36 items. 
      Divided by subsection, median scores for content, identification, and structure 
      data were 10 (IQR 9.5-12.5), 1 (IQR 1-1), and 4 (IQR 4-5), respectively. 
      Agreement between guideline recommendations and answers provided by ChatGPT was 
      60% (15/25). Interrater agreement as measured by the Fleiss Îº was 0.78 (P&lt;.001), 
      indicating substantial agreement. Internal consistency of the answers provided by 
      ChatGPT was 100%. CONCLUSIONS: ChatGPT provides medical information of comparable 
      quality to available static internet information. Although currently of limited 
      quality, large language models could become the future standard for patients and 
      health care professionals to gather medical information.

TI  - Quality of the Information provided by ChatGPT for Patients in Breast Plastic 
      Surgery: Are we already in the future?
PG  - 99-105
LID - 10.1016/j.jpra.2024.02.001 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has gained 
      popularity, even in the field of plastic surgery. It is increasingly common for 
      patients to use the internet to gather information about plastic surgery, and 
      AI-based chatbots, such as ChatGPT, could be employed to answer patients' 
      questions.The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of medical 
      information provided by ChatGPT regarding three of the most common procedures in 
      breast plastic surgery: breast reconstruction, breast reduction, and augmentation 
      mammaplasty. METHODS: The quality of information was evaluated through the 
      expanded EQIP scale. Responses were collected from a pool made by ten resident 
      doctors in plastic surgery and then processed by SPSS software ver. 28.0. 
      RESULTS: The analysis of the contents provided by ChatGPT revealed sufficient 
      quality of information across all selected topics, with a high bias in terms of 
      distribution of the score between the different items. There was a critical lack 
      in the "Information data field" (0/6 score in all the 3 investigations) but a 
      very high overall evaluation concerning the "Structure data" (&gt;7/11 in all the 3 
      investigations). CONCLUSION: Currently, AI serves as a valuable tool for 
      patients; however, engineers and developers must address certain critical issues. 
      It is possible that models like ChatGPT will play an important role in improving 
      patient's consciousness about medical procedures and surgical interventions in 
      the future, but their role must be considered ancillary to that of surgeons.

TI  - Opportunities and Challenges for ChatGPT and Large Language Models in Biomedicine 
      and Health.
LID - arXiv:2306.10070v2
AB  - ChatGPT has drawn considerable attention from both the general public and domain 
      experts with its remarkable text generation capabilities. This has subsequently 
      led to the emergence of diverse applications in the field of biomedicine and 
      health. In this work, we examine the diverse applications of large language 
      models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, in biomedicine and health. Specifically we 
      explore the areas of biomedical information retrieval, question answering, 
      medical text summarization, information extraction, and medical education, and 
      investigate whether LLMs possess the transformative power to revolutionize these 
      tasks or whether the distinct complexities of biomedical domain presents unique 
      challenges. Following an extensive literature survey, we find that significant 
      advances have been made in the field of text generation tasks, surpassing the 
      previous state-of-the-art methods. For other applications, the advances have been 
      modest. Overall, LLMs have not yet revolutionized biomedicine, but recent rapid 
      progress indicates that such methods hold great potential to provide valuable 
      means for accelerating discovery and improving health. We also find that the use 
      of LLMs, like ChatGPT, in the fields of biomedicine and health entails various 
      risks and challenges, including fabricated information in its generated 
      responses, as well as legal and privacy concerns associated with sensitive 
      patient data. We believe this survey can provide a comprehensive and timely 
      overview to biomedical researchers and healthcare practitioners on the 
      opportunities and challenges associated with using ChatGPT and other LLMs for 
      transforming biomedicine and health.

AB  - Objective ChatGPT is the first large language model (LLM) to reach a large, 
      mainstream audience. Its rapid adoption and exploration by the population at 
      large has sparked a wide range of discussions regarding its acceptable and 
      optimal integration in different areas. In a hybrid (virtual and in-person) panel 
      discussion event, we examined various perspectives regarding the use of ChatGPT 
      in education, research, and healthcare. Materials and Methods We surveyed 
      in-person and online attendees using an audience interaction platform (Slido). We 
      quantitatively analyzed received responses on questions about the use of ChatGPT 
      in various contexts. We compared pairwise categorical groups with Fisher's Exact. 
      Furthermore, we used qualitative methods to analyze and code discussions. Results 
      We received 420 responses from an estimated 844 participants (response rate 
      49.7%). Only 40% of the audience had tried ChatGPT. More trainees had tried 
      ChatGPT compared with faculty. Those who had used ChatGPT were more interested in 
      using it in a wider range of contexts going forwards. Of the three discussed 
      contexts, the greatest uncertainty was shown about using ChatGPT in education. 
      Pros and cons were raised during discussion for the use of this technology in 
      education, research, and healthcare. Discussion There was a range of perspectives 
      around the uses of ChatGPT in education, research, and healthcare, with still 
      much uncertainty around its acceptability and optimal uses. There were different 
      perspectives from respondents of different roles (trainee vs faculty vs staff). 
      More discussion is needed to explore perceptions around the use of LLMs such as 
      ChatGPT in vital sectors such as education, healthcare and research. Given 
      involved risks and unforeseen challenges, taking a thoughtful and measured 
      approach in adoption would reduce the likelihood of harm.

TI  - Performance of ChatGPT on the Peruvian National Licensing Medical Examination: 
      Cross-Sectional Study.
PG  - e48039
LID - 10.2196/48039 [doi]
LID - e48039
AB  - BACKGROUND: ChatGPT has shown impressive performance in national medical 
      licensing examinations, such as the United States Medical Licensing Examination 
      (USMLE), even passing it with expert-level performance. However, there is a lack 
      of research on its performance in low-income countries' national licensing 
      medical examinations. In Peru, where almost one out of three examinees fails the 
      national licensing medical examination, ChatGPT has the potential to enhance 
      medical education. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the accuracy of ChatGPT using 
      GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on the Peruvian National Licensing Medical Examination (Examen 
      Nacional de Medicina [ENAM]). Additionally, we sought to identify factors 
      associated with incorrect answers provided by ChatGPT. METHODS: We used the ENAM 
      2022 data set, which consisted of 180 multiple-choice questions, to evaluate the 
      performance of ChatGPT. Various prompts were used, and accuracy was evaluated. 
      The performance of ChatGPT was compared to that of a sample of 1025 examinees. 
      Factors such as question type, Peruvian-specific knowledge, discrimination, 
      difficulty, quality of questions, and subject were analyzed to determine their 
      influence on incorrect answers. Questions that received incorrect answers 
      underwent a three-step process involving different prompts to explore the 
      potential impact of adding roles and context on ChatGPT's accuracy. RESULTS: 
      GPT-4 achieved an accuracy of 86% on the ENAM, followed by GPT-3.5 with 77%. The 
      accuracy obtained by the 1025 examinees was 55%. There was a fair agreement 
      (Îº=0.38) between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Moderate-to-high-difficulty questions were 
      associated with incorrect answers in the crude and adjusted model for GPT-3.5 
      (odds ratio [OR] 6.6, 95% CI 2.73-15.95) and GPT-4 (OR 33.23, 95% CI 4.3-257.12). 
      After reinputting questions that received incorrect answers, GPT-3.5 went from 41 
      (100%) to 12 (29%) incorrect answers, and GPT-4 from 25 (100%) to 4 (16%). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) can achieve 
      expert-level performance on the ENAM, outperforming most of our examinees. We 
      found fair agreement between both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Incorrect answers were 
      associated with the difficulty of questions, which may resemble human 
      performance. Furthermore, by reinputting questions that initially received 
      incorrect answers with different prompts containing additional roles and context, 
      ChatGPT achieved improved accuracy.

AB  - The remarkable capabilities of generative artificial intelligence and large 
      language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have delighted users around the world. 
      Educators have regarded these tools as either a cause for great concern, an 
      opportunity to educate students on cutting-edge technology, or often some 
      combination of the two. Throughout the Fall 2023 semester, we explored the use of 
      ChatGPT (and Bard, among other LLMs) in a graduate level numerical and 
      statistical methods course for PhD-level bioengineers. In this article we share 
      examples of this ChatGPT content, our observations on what worked best in our 
      course, and speculate on how bioengineering students may be best served by this 
      technology in the future.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used in healthcare for some years for risk 
      detection, diagnostics, documentation, education and training and other purposes. 
      A&nbsp;new open AI application is ChatGPT, which is accessible to everyone. The 
      application of ChatGPT as AI in education, training or studies is currently being 
      discussed from many perspectives. It is questionable whether ChatGPT can and 
      should also support nursing professions in health care. The aim of this review 
      article is to show and critically discuss possible areas of application of 
      ChatGPT in theory and practice with a&nbsp;focus on nursing practice, pedagogy, 
      nursing research and nursing development.

TI  - Exploring the potential of ChatGPT as an adjunct for generating diagnosis based 
      on chief complaint and cone beam CT radiologic findings.
PG  - 55
LID - 10.1186/s12911-024-02445-y [doi]
LID - 55
AB  - AIM: This study aimed to assess the performance of OpenAI's ChatGPT in generating 
      diagnosis based on chief complaint and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) 
      radiologic findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 102 CBCT reports (48 with dental 
      diseases (DD) and 54 with neoplastic/cystic diseases (N/CD)) were collected. 
      ChatGPT was provided with chief complaint and CBCT radiologic findings. 
      Diagnostic outputs from ChatGPT were scored based on five-point Likert scale. For 
      diagnosis accuracy, the scoring was based on the accuracy of chief complaint 
      related diagnosis and chief complaint unrelated diagnoses (1-5 points); for 
      diagnosis completeness, the scoring was based on how many accurate diagnoses 
      included in ChatGPT's output for one case (1-5 points); for text quality, the 
      scoring was based on how many text errors included in ChatGPT's output for one 
      case (1-5 points). For 54&nbsp;N/CD cases, the consistence of the diagnosis generated 
      by ChatGPT with pathological diagnosis was also calculated. The constitution of 
      text errors in ChatGPT's outputs was evaluated. RESULTS: After subjective ratings 
      by expert reviewers on a five-point Likert scale, the final score of diagnosis 
      accuracy, diagnosis completeness and text quality of ChatGPT was 3.7, 4.5 and 4.6 
      for the 102 cases. For diagnostic accuracy, it performed significantly better on 
      N/CD (3.8/5) compared to DD (3.6/5). For 54&nbsp;N/CD cases, 21(38.9%) cases have 
      first diagnosis completely consistent with pathological diagnosis. No text errors 
      were observed in 88.7% of all the 390 text items. CONCLUSION: ChatGPT showed 
      potential in generating radiographic diagnosis based on chief complaint and 
      radiologic findings. However, the performance of ChatGPT varied with task 
      complexity, necessitating professional oversight due to a certain error rate.

TI  - Evaluation of ChatGPT in Predicting 6-Month Outcomes After Traumatic Brain 
      Injury.
LID - 10.1097/CCM.0000000000006236 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the capacity of ChatGPT, a widely accessible and uniquely 
      popular artificial intelligence-based chatbot, in predicting the 6-month outcome 
      following moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). DESIGN: Single-center 
      observational retrospective study. SETTING: Data are from a neuro-ICU from a 
      level 1 trauma center. PATIENTS: All TBI patients admitted to ICU between 
      September 2021 and October 2022 were included in a prospective database. 
      INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Based on anonymized clinical, 
      imaging, and biological information available at the patients' hospital admission 
      and extracted from the database, clinical vignettes were retrospectively 
      submitted to ChatGPT for prediction of patients' outcomes. The predictions of two 
      intensivists (one neurointensivist and one non-neurointensivist) both from 
      another level 1 trauma center (Beaujon Hospital), were also collected as was the 
      International Mission on Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in Traumatic 
      Brain Injury (IMPACT) scoring. Each intensivist, as well as ChatGPT, made their 
      prognostic evaluations independently, without knowledge of the others' 
      predictions and of the patients' actual management and outcome. Both the 
      intensivists and ChatGPT were given access to the exact same set of information. 
      The main outcome was a 6-month-functional status dichotomized into favorable 
      (Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended [GOSE] â¥ 5) versus poor (GOSE &lt; 5). Prediction of 
      intracranial hypertension management, pulmonary infectious risk, and removal of 
      life-sustaining therapies was also investigated as secondary outcomes. Eighty 
      consecutive moderate-to-severe TBI patients were included. For the 6-month 
      outcome prognosis, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
      (AUC-ROC) for ChatGPT, the neurointensivist, the non-neurointensivist, and IMPACT 
      were, respectively, 0.62 (0.50-0.74), 0.70 (0.59-0.82), 0.71 (0.59-0.82), and 
      0.81 (0.72-0.91). ChatGPT had the highest sensitivity (100%), but the lowest 
      specificity (26%). For secondary outcomes, ChatGPT's prognoses were generally 
      less accurate than clinicians' prognoses, with lower AUC values for most 
      outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This study does not support the use of ChatGPT for 
      prediction of outcomes after TBI.

TI  - Quality of information and appropriateness of ChatGPT outputs for urology 
      patients.
PG  - 103-108
LID - 10.1038/s41391-023-00705-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The proportion of health-related searches on the internet is 
      continuously growing. ChatGPT, a natural language processing (NLP) tool created 
      by OpenAI, has been gaining increasing user attention and can potentially be used 
      as a source for obtaining information related to health concerns. This study aims 
      to analyze the quality and appropriateness of ChatGPT's responses to Urology case 
      studies compared to those of a urologist. METHODS: Data from 100 patient case 
      studies, comprising patient demographics, medical history, and urologic 
      complaints, were sequentially inputted into ChatGPT, one by one. A question was 
      posed to determine the most likely diagnosis, suggested examinations, and 
      treatment options. The responses generated by ChatGPT were then compared to those 
      provided by a board-certified urologist who was blinded to ChatGPT's responses 
      and graded on a 5-point Likert scale based on accuracy, comprehensiveness, and 
      clarity as criterias for appropriateness. The quality of information was graded 
      based on the section 2 of the DISCERN tool and readability assessments were 
      performed using the Flesch Reading Ease (FRE) and Flesch-Kincaid Reading Grade 
      Level (FKGL) formulas. RESULTS: 52% of all responses were deemed appropriate. 
      ChatGPT provided more appropriate responses for non-oncology conditions (58.5%) 
      compared to oncology (52.6%) and emergency urology cases (11.1%) (pâ=â0.03). The 
      median score of the DISCERN tool was 15 (IQRâ=â5.3) corresponding to a quality 
      score of poor. The ChatGPT responses demonstrated a college graduate reading 
      level, as indicated by the median FRE score of 18 (IQRâ=â21) and the median FKGL 
      score of 15.8 (IQRâ=â3). CONCLUSIONS: ChatGPT serves as an interactive tool for 
      providing medical information online, offering the possibility of enhancing 
      health outcomes and patient satisfaction. Nevertheless, the insufficient 
      appropriateness and poor quality of the responses on Urology cases emphasizes the 
      importance of thorough evaluation and use of NLP-generated outputs when 
      addressing health-related concerns.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the responses of the large language model-based "ChatGPT" 
      to reputable sources when given fertility-related clinical prompts. DESIGN: The 
      "Feb 13" version of ChatGPT by OpenAI was tested against established sources 
      relating to patient-oriented clinical information: 17 "frequently asked questions 
      (FAQs)" about infertility on the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Website, 
      2&nbsp;validated fertility knowledge surveys, the Cardiff Fertility Knowledge Scale 
      and the Fertility and Infertility Treatment Knowledge Score, as well as the 
      American Society for Reproductive Medicine committee opinion "optimizing natural 
      fertility." SETTING: Academic medical center. PATIENT(S): Online AI Chatbot. 
      INTERVENTION(S): Frequently asked questions, survey questions and rephrased 
      summary statements were entered as prompts in the chatbot over a 1-week period in 
      February&nbsp;2023. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): For FAQs from CDC: words/response, 
      sentiment analysis polarity and objectivity, total factual statements, rate of 
      statements that were incorrect, referenced a source, or noted the value of 
      consulting providers. FOR FERTILITY KNOWLEDGE SURVEYS: Percentile according to 
      published population data. FOR COMMITTEE OPINION: Whether response to conclusions 
      rephrased as questions identified missing facts. RESULT(S): When administered the 
      CDC's 17 infertility FAQ's, ChatGPT produced responses of similar length (207.8 
      ChatGPT vs. 181.0 CDC words/response), factual content (8.65 factual 
      statements/response vs. 10.41), sentiment polarity (mean 0.11 vs. 0.11 on a scale 
      of -1 (negative) to 1 (positive)), and subjectivity (mean 0.42 vs. 0.35 on a 
      scale of 0 (objective) to 1 (subjective)). In total, 9 (6.12%) of 147 ChatGPT 
      factual statements were categorized as incorrect, and only 1 (0.68%) statement 
      cited a reference. ChatGPT would have been at the 87th percentile of Bunting's 
      2013 international cohort for the Cardiff Fertility&nbsp;Knowledge Scale and at the 
      95th percentile on the basis of Kudesia's 2017 cohort for the Fertility and 
      Infertility Treatment&nbsp;Knowledge Score. ChatGPT reproduced the missing facts for 
      all 7 summary statements from "optimizing natural fertility." CONCLUSION(S): A 
      February 2023 version of "ChatGPT" demonstrates the ability of generative 
      artificial intelligence to produce relevant, meaningful responses to 
      fertility-related clinical queries comparable to established sources. Although 
      performance may improve with medical domain-specific training, limitations such 
      as the inability to reliably cite sources and the unpredictable possibility of 
      fabricated information may limit its clinical use.

TI  - Analysing the Applicability of ChatGPT, Bard, and Bing to Generate 
      Reasoning-Based Multiple-Choice Questions in Medical Physiology.
PG  - e40977

AB  - Background Artificial intelligence (AI) is evolving in the medical education 
      system. ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Microsoft Bing are AI-based models that can 
      solve problems in medical education. However, the applicability of AI to create 
      reasoning-based multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in the field of medical 
      physiology is yet to be explored. Objective We aimed to assess and compare the 
      applicability of ChatGPT, Bard, and Bing in generating reasoning-based MCQs for 
      MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery) undergraduate students on the 
      subject of physiology. Methods The National Medical Commission of India has 
      developed an 11-module physiology curriculum with various competencies. Two 
      physiologists independently chose a competency from each module. The third 
      physiologist prompted all three AIs to generate five MCQs for each chosen 
      competency. The two physiologists who provided the competencies rated the MCQs 
      generated by the AIs on a scale of 0-3 for validity, difficulty, and reasoning 
      ability required to answer them. We analyzed the average of the two scores using 
      the Kruskal-Wallis test to compare the distribution across the total and 
      module-wise responses, followed by a post-hoc test for pairwise comparisons. We 
      used Cohen's Kappa (Î) to assess the agreement in scores between the two raters. 
      We expressed the data as a median with an interquartile range. We determined 
      their statistical significance by a p-value &lt;0.05. Results ChatGPT and Bard 
      generated 110 MCQs for the chosen competencies. However, Bing provided only 100 
      MCQs as it failed to generate them for two competencies. The validity of the MCQs 
      was rated as 3 (3-3) for ChatGPT, 3 (1.5-3) for Bard, and 3 (1.5-3) for Bing, 
      showing a significant difference (p&lt;0.001) among the models. The difficulty of 
      the MCQs was rated as 1 (0-1) for ChatGPT, 1 (1-2) for Bard, and 1 (1-2) for 
      Bing, with a significant difference (p=0.006). The required reasoning ability to 
      answer the MCQs was rated as 1 (1-2) for ChatGPT, 1 (1-2) for Bard, and 1 (1-2) 
      for Bing, with no significant difference (p=0.235). K was â¥ 0.8 for all three 
      parameters across all three AI models. Conclusion AI still needs to evolve to 
      generate reasoning-based MCQs in medical physiology. ChatGPT, Bard, and Bing 
      showed certain limitations. Bing generated significantly least valid MCQs, while 
      ChatGPT generated significantly least difficult MCQs.

AB  - The advent of ChatGPT has sparked a heated debate surrounding natural language 
      processing technology and AI-powered chatbots, leading to extensive research and 
      applications across various disciplines. This pilot study aims to investigate the 
      impact of ChatGPT on users' experiences by administering two distinct 
      questionnaires, one generated by humans and the other by ChatGPT, along with an 
      Emotion Detecting Model. A total of 14 participants (7 female and 7 male) aged 
      between 18 and 35&nbsp;years were recruited, resulting in the collection of 8672 
      ChatGPT-associated data points and 8797 human-associated data points. Data 
      analysis was conducted using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The results indicate 
      that the utilization of ChatGPT enhances participants' happiness levels and 
      reduces their sadness levels. While no significant gender influences were 
      observed, variations were found about specific emotions. It is important to note 
      that the limited sample size, narrow age range, and potential cultural impacts 
      restrict the generalizability of the findings to a broader population. Future 
      research directions should explore the impact of incorporating additional 
      language models or chatbots on user emotions, particularly among specific age 
      groups such as older individuals and teenagers. As one of the pioneering works 
      evaluating the human perception of ChatGPT text and communication, it is 
      noteworthy that ChatGPT received positive evaluations and demonstrated 
      effectiveness in generating extensive questionnaires.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychiatry is a specialized field of medicine that focuses on the 
      diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of mental health disorders. With 
      advancements in technology and the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), there 
      has been a growing interest in exploring the potential of AI language models 
      systems, such as Chat Generative Pre-training Transformer (ChatGPT), to assist in 
      the field of psychiatry. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to evaluates the 
      effectiveness, reliability and safeness of ChatGPT in assisting patients with 
      mental health problems, and to assess its potential as a collaborative tool for 
      mental health professionals through a simulated interaction with three distinct 
      imaginary patients. METHODS: Three imaginary patient scenarios (cases A, B, and 
      C) were created, representing different mental health problems. All three 
      patients present with, and seek to eliminate, the same chief complaint (i.e., 
      difficulty falling asleep and waking up frequently during the night in the last 
      2Â°weeks). ChatGPT was engaged as a virtual psychiatric assistant to provide 
      responses and treatment recommendations. RESULTS: In case A, the recommendations 
      were relatively appropriate (albeit non-specific), and could potentially be 
      beneficial for both users and clinicians. However, as complexity of clinical 
      cases increased (cases B and C), the information and recommendations generated by 
      ChatGPT became inappropriate, even dangerous; and the limitations of the program 
      became more glaring. The main strengths of ChatGPT lie in its ability to provide 
      quick responses to user queries and to simulate empathy. One notable limitation 
      is ChatGPT inability to interact with users to collect further information 
      relevant to the diagnosis and management of a patient's clinical condition. 
      Another serious limitation is ChatGPT inability to use critical thinking and 
      clinical judgment to drive patient's management. CONCLUSION: As for July 2023, 
      ChatGPT failed to give the simple medical advice given certain clinical 
      scenarios. This supports that the quality of ChatGPT-generated content is still 
      far from being a guide for users and professionals to provide accurate mental 
      health information. It remains, therefore, premature to conclude on the 
      usefulness and safety of ChatGPT in mental health practice.

AB  - In the last year, Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT), a web 
      software based on artificial intelligence has been showing high potential in 
      every field of knowledge. In the medical area, its possible application is an 
      object of many studies with promising results. We performed the current study to 
      investigate the possible usefulness of ChatGPT in assessing low back pain. We 
      asked ChatGPT to generate a questionnaire about this clinical condition and we 
      compared the obtained questions and results with the ones obtained by other 
      validated questionnaires: Oswestry Disability Index, Quebec Back Pain Disability 
      Scale, Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, and Numeric Rating Scale for pain. 
      We enrolled 20 subjects with low back pain and we found important consistencies 
      among the validated questionnaires. The ChatGPT questionnaire showed an 
      acceptable significant correlation only with Oswestry Disability Index and Quebec 
      Back Pain Disability Scale. ChatGPT showed some peculiarities, especially in the 
      assessment of quality of life and medical consultation and treatments. Our study 
      shows that ChatGPT can help evaluate patients, including multilevel perspectives. 
      However, its power is limited, and further research and validation are required.

COIS- We confirm that we have read the Journalâs position on issues involved in ethical 
      publication and affirm that this report is consistent with those guidelines. 
      During the last year, one of the potential greatest revolutions impacting 
      humankind has been happening: the worldwide availability of chatbots based on 
      artificial intelligence (AI). In particular, on November 30th, 2022, Chat 
      Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) was released. It is an online 
      software able to communicate in a human-similar way and to answer specific 
      questions. Furthermore, as an AI system, it can learn from the information that 
      the user provides and dynamically interact with the human being.2 This type of 
      chatbot distinguishes itself from simple web-based software because of its 
      adaptability. Indeed, it can tailor its responses to various situations and to 
      learn from errors and diverse inputs. This capability is advantageous for solving 
      a wide range of problems by retrieving information from a vast dataset. Its 
      practical applications are highly diverse and may virtually include every field 
      of knowledge. For work activities, it can solve equations or help in computer 
      programming; for leisure time, it can provide suggestions about a trip or invent 
      a game; for daily life, it can support text or email writing; and so on. It has, 
      at the moment, different limitations, due to the information that the ChatGPT 
      programmers used to train it, covering a time range until the end of 2021, and to 
      the immaturity of some procedures. For example, ChatGPT has some difficulties in 
      elaborating very long or highly specific texts. Additionally, too complex tasks 
      can lead to errors and the accuracy of the responses depends on the precision of 
      the questions.1 Despite these current limitations, the chatbot has demonstrated 
      remarkable potential as an assistive technology and our comprehension of its 
      capabilities is probably only in the early stages. In the few months of its 
      availability, even in the medical field, we have been observing a growing 
      utilization with extraordinary outcomes. The tool can combine different 
      information from literature and scientific databases, contributing to the 
      interpretation of research findings or the discovery of new solutions for 
      projects. Various studies have identified potential roles for chatbots in 
      supporting physicians' training, particularly in summarizing patient variables 
      and extracting relevant information from extensive datasets, like big data 
      analysis. Moreover, for medical students, chatbots can assist in research, essay 
      writing, or thesis work. In the medical field, this AI can also support 
      patient-physician communication, simplifying medical explanations with everyday 
      language, assessing and consolidating symptom descriptions, and facilitating 
      translations of medical data into various languages. ChatGPT can also be 
      beneficial for patients, providing suggestions for a health or dietary plan or 
      indicating the most appropriate medical specialist. Importantly, the chatbot 
      underscores its restricted role in its responses, emphasizing the importance of 
      the consultation of an irreplaceable human expert in cases that require 
      specialized medical attention. Besides the incredible positive impact on the work 
      and the study, the risks of misunderstood are always behind the corner. 
      Additionally, the peril of dehumanization of medical activity and the tendency to 
      reduce the effort toward effective work are the potential side effects of the 
      increasing use of AI. Moreover, the utilization of this tool for certain tasks 
      raises complex ethical concerns, like the production of scientific items sold as 
      authorsâ original production but really made by a computer. Therefore, currently, 
      ChatGPT cannot replace human doctors and scientists. Nonetheless, we should avoid 
      prejudicial judgment and we need to study all the main real effects that the 
      chatbot may produce. Considering its medical applications, limited examples may 
      be found in questionnaire assessments or in constructing new specific 
      questionnaires. The existing questionnaires for understanding patients' 
      perspectives on diseases are well-established, validated, and easy to administer. 
      However, there is a risk of incompleteness in these questionnaires. Furthermore, 
      as patient needs continually evolve with societal changes, updating historical 
      questionnaires becomes desirable. Typically, questionnaire development starts 
      with collecting qualitative or semi-quantitative data from a large database 
      obtained through a survey. The first problems in this procedure are related to 
      the choice of the initial questions and the answer options used for the survey, 
      the language, and, especially, the lexicon. Even the communication channel and 
      the correct choice of the interviewed people may greatly affect the answers. 
      After data collection, a simplification process is necessary to construct the 
      actual questionnaire, which must undergo testing for validity and reliability.9 
      Once a questionnaire passes these stages, additional processes of cross-cultural 
      validation and adaptation are needed for translation and application in cultures 
      and languages different from those for which the questionnaire was originally 
      developed.9 This brief description of the intense phases of questionnaire 
      development suggests the possible aid of ChatGPT for this purpose. The chatbot 
      can combine data from other existing questionnaires, and scientific and not 
      academic information from the entire world, and can translate the document with 
      precision. Building upon these considerations, we aim to create a questionnaire 
      for the assessment of [low back pain (LBP)] using ChatGPT and to evaluate its 
      effectiveness by comparing it with routinely used validated questionnaires.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Conversational chatbots, fueled by large language models, spark 
      debate over their potential in education and medical career exams. There is 
      debate in the literature about the scientific integrity of the outputs produced 
      by these chatbots. AIMS: This study evaluates ChatGPT 3.5 and Perplexity AI's 
      cross-sectional performance in responding to questions from the 2023 Italian 
      national residency admission exam (SSM23), comparing results and chatbots' 
      concordance with previous years SSMs. METHODS: Gastroenterology-related SSM23 
      questions were input into ChatGPT 3.5 and Perplexity AI, evaluating their 
      performance in correct responses and total scores. This process was repeated with 
      questions from the three preceding years. Additionally, chatbot concordance was 
      assessed using Cohen's method. RESULTS: In SSM23, ChatGPT 3.5 outperforms 
      Perplexity AI with 94.11% correct responses, demonstrating consistency across 
      years. Concordance weakened in 2023 (Îº=0.203, P = 0.148), but ChatGPT 
      consistently maintains a high standard compared to Perplexity AI. CONCLUSION: 
      ChatGPT 3.5 and Perplexity AI exhibit promise in addressing gastroenterological 
      queries, emphasizing potential educational roles. However, their variable 
      performance mandates cautious use as supplementary tools alongside conventional 
      study methods. Clear guidelines are crucial for educators to balance traditional 
      approaches and innovative systems, enhancing educational standards.

AB  - Artificial intelligence has lately proven useful in the field of medical 
      genetics. It is already being used to interpret genome sequences and diagnose 
      patients based on facial recognition. More recently, large-language models (LLMs) 
      such as ChatGPT have been tested for their capacity to provide medical genetics 
      information. It was found that ChatGPT performed similarly to human respondents 
      in factual and critical thinking questions, albeit with reduced accuracy in the 
      latter. In particular, ChatGPT's performance in questions related to calculating 
      the recurrence risk was dismal, despite only having to deal with a single 
      disease. To see if challenging ChatGPT with more difficult problems may reveal 
      its flaws and their bases, it was asked to solve recurrence risk problems dealing 
      with two diseases instead of one. Interestingly, it managed to correctly 
      understand the mode of inheritance of recessive diseases, yet it incorrectly 
      calculated the probability of having a healthy child. Other LLMs were also tested 
      and showed similar noise. This highlights a major limitation for clinical use. 
      While this shortcoming may be solved in the near future, LLMs may not be ready 
      yet to be used as an effective clinical tool in communicating medical genetics 
      information.

      in managing their operations and services. METHODS: A qualitative approach with 
      focus groups is adopted in this study. A total of 54 participants with varying 
      degrees of experience using AI such as ChatGPT in healthcare, including 11 
      physicians, 24 nurses, eight dieticians, six pharmacists, and five 
      physiotherapists providing teleconsultations participated in this study. RESULTS: 
      Twelve themes including informational support, diagnostic assistance, 
      communication, enhancing efficiency, cost and time saving, personalizing care, 
      multilingual support, assisting in medical research, decision-making, 
      documentation, continuing education, and enhanced team collaboration reflecting 
      positive impact were identified from the data analysis of seven focus groups. In 
      addition, six themes including misdiagnosis and errors, issues in personalized 
      care, ethical and legal issues, limited medical context/knowledge, communication 
      challenges, and increased dependency reflecting negative impact were identified. 
      CONCLUSION: Although ChatGPT has several advantages for teleconsultants in the 
      healthcare sector, it is associated with ethical issues.

TI  - Ethics Education for Healthcare Professionals in the Era of ChatGPT and Other 
      Large Language Models: Do We Still Need It?
PG  - 17-27
LID - 10.1080/15265161.2023.2233358 [doi]
AB  - In this paper, we contend with whether we still need traditional ethics education 
      as part of healthcare professional training given the abilities of chatGPT 
      (generative pre-trained transformer) and other large language models (LLM). We 
      reflect on common programmatic goals to assess the current strengths and 
      limitations of LLMs in helping to build ethics competencies among future 
      clinicians. Through an actual case analysis, we highlight areas in which chatGPT 
      and other LLMs are conducive to common bioethics education goals. We also comment 
      on where such technologies remain an imperfect substitute for human-led ethics 
      teaching and learning. Finally, we conclude that the relative strengths of 
      chatGPT warrant its consideration as a teaching and learning tool in ethics 
      education in ways that account for current limitations and build in flexibility 
      as the technology evolves.

      everyday medical practice?].
PG  - 366-371
LID - 10.1007/s00063-023-01019-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the free provision of the chat robot "ChatGPT" by the company 
      OpenAI in November 2022, an application of artificial intelligence (AI) became 
      tangible for everyone. OBJECTIVES: An explanation of the basic functionality of 
      large language models (LLM) is given, followed by a presentation of application 
      options of ChatGPT in medicine, and an outlook and discussion of possible dangers 
      of AI applications. METHODS: Problem solving with ChatGPT using concrete 
      examples. Analysis and discussion of the available scientific literature. 
      RESULTS: There has been a significant increase in the use of AI applications in 
      scientific work, especially in scientific writing. Wide application of LLM in 
      writing medical documentation is conceivable. Technical functionality allows the 
      use of AI applications as a&nbsp;diagnostic support system. There is a&nbsp;risk of 
      spreading and entrenching inaccuracies and bias through application of LLM. 
      Regulation of this new technology is pending. CONCLUSION: AI applications such as 
      ChatGPT have the potential to permanently change everyday medical practice. An 
      examination of this technology and evaluation of opportunities and risks is 
      warranted.

AB  - ChatGPT is an open artificial intelligence chat box that could revolutionize 
      academia and augment research writing. This study had an open conversation with 
      ChatGPT and invited the platform to evaluate this article through series of five 
      questions on base of thumb arthritis to test if its contributions and contents 
      merely add artificial unusable input or help us augment the quality of the 
      article. The information ChatGPT-3 provided was accurate, albeit surface-level, 
      and lacks analytical ability to dissect for important limitations about base of 
      thumb arthritis, which would not be conducive to potentiating creative ideas and 
      solutions in plastic surgery. ChatGPT failed to provide relevant references and 
      even "created" references instead of indicating its inability to perform the 
      task. This highlights that as an AI-generator for medical publishing text, 
      ChatGPT-3 should be used cautiously.

TI  - Assessing the Utility of ChatGPT in Simplifying Text Complexity of Patient 
      Educational Materials.
PG  - e55304

LID - e55304
AB  - INTRODUCTION: AI chatbots are being increasingly used in healthcare settings. 
      There is growing interest in using AI to assist in patient education. Currently, 
      extensive healthcare information is found online but is often too complex to 
      understand. Our objective is to determine if physicians can recommend the free 
      version of ChatGPT version 3.5 (OpenAI, San Francisco, CA, USA) for patients to 
      simplify text from the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) in English and 
      Spanish. This version of ChatGPT was assessed in this study due to its increased 
      accessibility across various patient populations. METHODS: Fifteen articles were 
      chosen from AAO in both languages and simplified with ChatGPT 10 times each. The 
      readability of original and simplified articles was assessed with the Flesch 
      Reading Ease and Gunning Fog Index for English and FernÃ¡ndez Huerta, GutiÃ©rrez, 
      Szigriszt-Pazo, INFLESZ, and Legibilidad-Âµ for Spanish. Grade levels to assess 
      readability were calculated with Flesch Kincaid Grade Level and Crawford 
      Nivel-de-Grado. Mean, standard deviation, and two-tailed t-tests were performed 
      to assess differences before and after simplification. RESULTS: Average grade 
      levels before and after simplification were as follows: English 8.43Â±1.17 to 
      8.9Â±2.1 (p=0.41) and Spanish 5.3Â±0.34 to 4.1Â±1.1 (p=0.0001). Spanish articles 
      were significantly simplified per Legibilidad-Âµ (p=0.003). No significant 
      difference was noted for other scales. CONCLUSIONS: The readability of AAO 
      articles in English worsened without significance but significantly improved in 
      Spanish. This may result from simpler syllable structures and a lesser overall 
      vocabulary in Spanish. With increased testing, physicians can recommend ChatGPT 
      for Spanish-speaking patients to improve health literacy.

PG  - 353-358
LID - 10.1080/03007995.2024.2310086 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT-4 have raised critical 
      questions regarding their distinguishability from human-generated content. In 
      this research, we evaluated the effectiveness of online detection tools in 
      identifying ChatGPT-4 vs human-written text. METHODS: A two texts produced by 
      ChatGPT-4 using differing prompts and one text created by a human author were 
      analytically assessed using the following online detection tools: GPTZero, 
      ZeroGPT, Writer ACD, and Originality. RESULTS: The findings revealed a notable 
      variance in the detection capabilities of the employed detection tools. GPTZero 
      and ZeroGPT exhibited inconsistent assessments regarding the AI-origin of the 
      texts. Writer ACD predominantly identified texts as human-written, whereas 
      Originality consistently recognized the AI-generated content in both samples from 
      ChatGPT-4. This highlights Originality's enhanced sensitivity to patterns 
      characteristic of AI-generated text. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates that 
      while automatic detection tools may discern texts generated by ChatGPT-4 
      significant variability exists in their accuracy. Undoubtedly, there is an urgent 
      need for advanced detection tools to ensure the authenticity and integrity of 
      content, especially in scientific and academic research. However, our findings 
      underscore an urgent need for more refined detection methodologies to prevent the 
      misdetection of human-written content as AI-generated and vice versa.

AB  - Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gathered attention with the release of 
      ChatGPT, a user-centered chatbot released by OpenAI. In this perspective article, 
      we retrace the evolution of LLMs to understand the revolution brought by ChatGPT 
      in the artificial intelligence (AI) field. The opportunities offered by LLMs in 
      supporting scientific research are multiple and various models have already been 
      tested in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks in this domain. The impact of 
      ChatGPT has been huge for the general public and the research community, with 
      many authors using the chatbot to write part of their articles and some papers 
      even listing ChatGPT as an author. Alarming ethical and practical challenges 
      emerge from the use of LLMs, particularly in the medical field for the potential 
      impact on public health. Infodemic is a trending topic in public health and the 
      ability of LLMs to rapidly produce vast amounts of text could leverage 
      misinformation spread at an unprecedented scale, this could create an "AI-driven 
      infodemic," a novel public health threat. Policies to contrast this phenomenon 
      need to be rapidly elaborated, the inability to accurately detect 
      artificial-intelligence-produced text is an unresolved issue.

TI  - Can ChatGPT help patients answer their otolaryngology questions?
PG  - e1193
LID - 10.1002/lio2.1193 [doi]
LID - e1193
AB  - BACKGROUND: Over the past year, the world has been captivated by the potential of 
      artificial intelligence (AI). The appetite for AI in science, specifically 
      healthcare is huge. It is imperative to understand the credibility of large 
      language models in assisting the public in medical queries. OBJECTIVE: To 
      evaluate the ability of ChatGPT to provide reasonably accurate answers to public 
      queries within the domain of Otolaryngology. METHODS: Two board-certified 
      otolaryngologists (HZ, RS) inputted 30 text-based patient queries into the 
      ChatGPT-3.5 model. ChatGPT responses were rated by physicians on a scale 
      (accurate, partially accurate, incorrect), while a similar 3-point scale 
      involving confidence was given to layperson reviewers. Demographic data involving 
      gender and education level was recorded for the public reviewers. Inter-rater 
      agreement percentage was based on binomial distribution for calculating the 95% 
      confidence intervals and performing significance tests. Statistical significance 
      was defined as pâ&lt;â.05 for two-sided tests. RESULTS: In testing patient queries, 
      both Otolaryngology physicians found that ChatGPT answered 98.3% of questions 
      correctly, but only 79.8% (range 51.7%-100%) of patients were confident that the 
      AI model was accurate in its responses (corrected agreementâ=â0.682; pâ&lt;â.001). 
      Among the layperson responses, the corrected coefficient was of moderate 
      agreement (0.571; pâ&lt;â.001). No correlation was noted among age, gender, or 
      education level for the layperson responses. CONCLUSION: ChatGPT is highly 
      accurate in responding to questions posed by the public with regards to 
      Otolaryngology from a physician standpoint. Public reviewers were not fully 
      confident in believing the AI model, with subjective concerns related to less 
      trust in AI answers compared to physician explanation. Larger evaluations with a 
      representative public sample and broader medical questions should immediately be 
      conducted by appropriate organizations, governing bodies, and/or governmental 
      agencies to instill public confidence in AI and ChatGPT as a medical resource. 
      LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.

TI  - ChatGPT-A double-edged sword for healthcare education? Implications for 
      assessments of dental students.
PG  - 206-211
LID - 10.1111/eje.12937 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Open-source generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications 
      are fast-transforming access to information and allow students to prepare 
      assignments and offer quite accurate responses to a wide range of exam questions 
      which are routinely used in assessments of students across the board including 
      undergraduate dental students. This study aims to evaluate the performance of 
      Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT), a generative AI-based 
      application, on a wide range of assessments used in contemporary healthcare 
      education and discusses the implications for undergraduate dental education. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was an exploratory study investigating the accuracy 
      of ChatGPT to attempt a range of recognised assessments in healthcare education 
      curricula. A total of 50 independent items encompassing 50 different learning 
      outcomes (nâ=â10 per item) were developed by the research team. These included 10 
      separate items based on each of the five commonly used question formats including 
      multiple-choice questions (MCQs); short-answer questions (SAQs); short essay 
      questions (SEQs); single true/false questions; and fill in the blanks items. Chat 
      GPT was used to attempt each of these 50 questions. In addition, ChatGPT was used 
      to generate reflective reports based on multisource feedback; research 
      methodology; and critical appraisal of the literature. RESULTS: ChatGPT 
      application provided accurate responses to majority of knowledge-based 
      assessments based on MCQs, SAQs, SEQs, true/false and fill in the blanks items. 
      However, it was only able to answer text-based questions and did not allow 
      processing of questions based on images. Responses generated to written 
      assignments were also satisfactory apart from those for critical appraisal of 
      literature. Word count was the key limitation observed in outputs generated by 
      the free version of ChatGPT. CONCLUSION: Notwithstanding their current 
      limitations, generative AI-based applications have the potential to revolutionise 
      virtual learning. Instead of treating it as a threat, healthcare educators need 
      to adapt teaching and assessments in medical and dental education to the benefits 
      of the learners while mitigating against dishonest use of AI-based technology.

AB  - PURPOSE: The quality of radiology referrals influences patient management and 
      imaging interpretation by radiologists. The aim of this study was to evaluate 
      ChatGPT-4 as a decision support tool for selecting imaging examinations and 
      generating radiology referrals in the emergency department (ED). METHODS: Five 
      consecutive clinical notes from the ED were retrospectively extracted, for each 
      of the following pathologies: pulmonary embolism, obstructing kidney stones, 
      acute appendicitis, diverticulitis, small bowel obstruction, acute cholecystitis, 
      acute hip fracture, and testicular torsion. A total of 40 cases were included. 
      These notes were entered into ChatGPT-4, requesting recommendations on the most 
      appropriate imaging examinations and protocols. The chatbot was also asked to 
      generate radiology referrals. Two independent radiologists graded the referral on 
      a scale ranging from 1 to 5 for clarity, clinical relevance, and differential 
      diagnosis. The chatbot's imaging recommendations were compared with the ACR 
      Appropriateness Criteria (AC) and with the examinations performed in the ED. 
      Agreement between readers was assessed using linear weighted Cohen's Îº 
      coefficient. RESULTS: ChatGPT-4's imaging recommendations aligned with the ACR AC 
      and ED examinations in all cases. Protocol discrepancies between ChatGPT and the 
      ACR AC were observed in two cases (5%). ChatGPT-4-generated referrals received 
      mean scores of 4.6 and 4.8 for clarity, 4.5 and 4.4 for clinical relevance, and 
      4.9 from both reviewers for differential diagnosis. Agreement between readers was 
      moderate for clinical relevance and clarity and substantial for differential 
      diagnosis grading. CONCLUSIONS: ChatGPT-4 has shown potential in aiding imaging 
      study selection for select clinical cases. As a complementary tool, large 
      language models may improve radiology referral quality. Radiologists should stay 
      informed about this technology and be mindful of potential challenges and risks.

TI  - Methodological insights into ChatGPT's screening performance in systematic 
      reviews.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The screening process for systematic reviews and meta-analyses in 
      medical research is a labor-intensive and time-consuming task. While machine 
      learning and deep learning have been applied to facilitate this process, these 
      methods often require training data and user annotation. This study aims to 
      assess the efficacy of ChatGPT, a large language model based on the Generative 
      Pretrained Transformers (GPT) architecture, in automating the screening process 
      for systematic reviews in radiology without the need for training data. METHODS: 
      A prospective simulation study was conducted between May 2nd and 24th, 2023, 
      comparing ChatGPT's performance in screening abstracts against that of general 
      physicians (GPs). A total of 1198 abstracts across three subfields of radiology 
      were evaluated. Metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative 
      predictive values (PPV and NPV), workload saving, and others were employed. 
      Statistical analyses included the Kappa coefficient for inter-rater agreement, 
      ROC curve plotting, AUC calculation, and bootstrapping for p-values and 
      confidence intervals. RESULTS: ChatGPT completed the screening process within an 
      hour, while GPs took an average of 7-10 days. The AI model achieved a sensitivity 
      of 95% and an NPV of 99%, slightly outperforming the GPs' sensitive consensus 
      (i.e., including records if at least one person includes them). It also exhibited 
      remarkably low false negative counts and high workload savings, ranging from 40 
      to 83%. However, ChatGPT had lower specificity and PPV compared to human raters. 
      The average Kappa agreement between ChatGPT and other raters was 0.27. 
      CONCLUSIONS: ChatGPT shows promise in automating the article screening phase of 
      systematic reviews, achieving high sensitivity and workload savings. While not 
      entirely replacing human expertise, it could serve as an efficient first-line 
      screening tool, particularly in reducing the burden on human resources. Further 
      studies are needed to fine-tune its capabilities and validate its utility across 
      different medical subfields.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the accuracy of ChatGPT in addressing 
      insomnia-related queries for patient education and assessed ChatGPT's ability to 
      provide varied responses based on differing prompting scenarios. METHODS: Four 
      identical sets of 20 insomnia-related queries were posed to ChatGPT. Each set 
      differed by the context in which ChatGPT was prompted: no prompt, 
      patient-centered, physician-centered, and with references and statistics. 
      Responses were reviewed by 2 academic sleep surgeons, 1 academic sleep medicine 
      physician, and 2 sleep medicine fellows across 4 domains: clinical accuracy, 
      prompt adherence, referencing, and statistical precision, using a binary grading 
      system. Flesch-Kincaid grade-level scores were calculated to estimate the grade 
      level of the responses, with statistical differences between prompts analyzed via 
      analysis of variance and Tukey's test. Interrater reliability was calculated 
      using Fleiss's kappa. RESULTS: The study revealed significant variations in the 
      Flesch-Kincaid grade-level scores across 4 prompts: unprompted (13.2 Â± 2.2), 
      patient-centered (8.1 Â± 1.9), physician-centered (15.4 Â± 2.8), and with 
      references and statistics (17.3 Â± 2.3, P &lt; .001). Despite poor Fleiss kappa 
      scores, indicating low interrater reliability for clinical accuracy and 
      relevance, all evaluators agreed that the majority of ChatGPT's responses were 
      clinically accurate, with the highest variability on Form 4. The responses were 
      also uniformly relevant to the given prompts (100% agreement). Eighty percent of 
      the references ChatGPT cited were verified as both real and relevant, and only 
      25% of cited statistics were corroborated within referenced articles. 
      CONCLUSIONS: ChatGPT can be used to generate clinically accurate responses to 
      insomnia-related inquiries. CITATION: Alapati R, Campbell D, Molin N, et&nbsp;al.

      the Medical Literature: Concise Review.

AB  - BACKGROUND: ChatGPT is a 175-billion-parameter natural language processing model 
      that is already involved in scientific content and publications. Its influence 
      ranges from providing quick access to information on medical topics, assisting in 
      generating medical and scientific articles and papers, performing medical data 
      analyses, and even interpreting complex data sets. OBJECTIVE: The future role of 
      ChatGPT remains uncertain and a matter of debate already shortly after its 
      release. This review aimed to analyze the role of ChatGPT in the medical 
      literature during the first 3 months after its release. METHODS: We performed a 
      concise review of literature published in PubMed from December 1, 2022, to March 
      31, 2023. To find all publications related to ChatGPT or considering ChatGPT, the 
      search term was kept simple ("ChatGPT" in AllFields). All publications available 
      as full text in German or English were included. All accessible publications were 
      evaluated according to specifications by the author team (eg, impact factor, 
      publication modus, article type, publication speed, and type of ChatGPT 
      integration or content). The conclusions of the articles were used for later SWOT 
      (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis. All data were 
      analyzed on a descriptive basis. RESULTS: Of 178 studies in total, 160 met the 
      inclusion criteria and were evaluated. The average impact factor was 4.423 (range 
      0-96.216), and the average publication speed was 16 (range 0-83) days. Among the 
      articles, there were 77 editorials (48,1%), 43 essays (26.9%), 21 studies 
      (13.1%), 6 reviews (3.8%), 6 case reports (3.8%), 6 news (3.8%), and 1 
      meta-analysis (0.6%). Of those, 54.4% (n=87) were published as open access, with 
      5% (n=8) provided on preprint servers. Over 400 quotes with information on 
      strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats were detected. By far, most 
      (n=142, 34.8%) were related to weaknesses. ChatGPT excels in its ability to 
      express ideas clearly and formulate general contexts comprehensibly. It performs 
      so well that even experts in the field have difficulty identifying abstracts 
      generated by ChatGPT. However, the time-limited scope and the need for 
      corrections by experts were mentioned as weaknesses and threats of ChatGPT. 
      Opportunities include assistance in formulating medical issues for nonnative 
      English speakers, as well as the possibility of timely participation in the 
      development of such artificial intelligence tools since it is in its early stages 
      and can therefore still be influenced. CONCLUSIONS: Artificial intelligence tools 
      such as ChatGPT are already part of the medical publishing landscape. Despite 
      their apparent opportunities, policies and guidelines must be implemented to 
      ensure benefits in education, clinical practice, and research and protect against 
      threats such as scientific misconduct, plagiarism, and inaccuracy.

TI  - Implications of ChatGPT in Public Health Dentistry: A Systematic Review.
PG  - e40367
LID - 10.7759/cureus.40367 [doi]
LID - e40367
AB  - An artificial intelligence (AI) program called ChatGPT that generates text in 
      response to typed commands has proven to be highly popular, as evidenced by the 
      fact that OpenAI makes it available online. The goal of the present investigation 
      was to investigate ChatGPT's potential applications as an outstanding instance of 
      large language models (LLMs) in the fields of public dental health schooling, 
      writing for academic use, research in public dental health, and clinical practice 
      in public dental health based on the available data. Importantly, the goals of 
      the current review included locating any drawbacks and issues that might be 
      connected to using ChatGPT in the previously mentioned contexts in healthcare 
      settings. Using search phrases including chatGPT, implications, artificial 
      intelligence (AI), public health dentistry, public health, practice in public 
      health dentistry, education in public health dentistry, academic writing in 
      public health dentistry, etc., a thorough search was carried out on the Pubmed 
      database, the Embase database, the Ovid database, the Global Health database, 
      PsycINFO, and the Web of Science. The dates of publication were not restricted. 
      Systematic searches were carried out for all publications according to inclusion 
      and exclusion criteria between March 31, 2018, and March 31, 2023. Eighty-four 
      papers were obtained through a literature search using search terms. Sixteen 
      similar and duplicate papers were excluded and 68 distinct articles were 
      initially selected. Thirty-three articles were excluded after reviewing abstracts 
      and titles. Thirty-five papers were selected, for which full text was managed. 
      Four extra papers were found manually from references. Thirty-nine articles with 
      full texts were eligible for the study. Eighteen inadequate articles are excluded 
      from the final 21 studies that were finally selected for systemic review. 
      According to previously published studies, ChatGPT has demonstrated its 
      effectiveness in helping scholars with the authoring of scientific research and 
      dental studies.&nbsp;If the right structures are created, ChatGPT can offer suitable 
      responses and more time to concentrate on the phase of experimentation for 
      scientists. Risks include prejudice in the training data, undervaluing human 
      skills, the possibility of fraud in science, as well as legal and reproducibility 
      concerns. It was concluded that practice considering ChatGPT's potential 
      significance, the research's uniqueness, and the premise-the activity of the 
      human brain-remains. While there is no question about the superiority of 
      incorporating ChatGPT into the practice of public health dentistry, it does not, 
      in any way, take the place of a dentist since clinical practice involves more 
      than just making diagnoses; it also involves relating to clinical findings and 
      providing individualized patient care. Even though AI can be useful in a number 
      of ways, a dentist must ultimately make the decision because dentistry is a field 
      that involves several disciplines.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Large language models like ChatGPT have revolutionized the field of 
      natural language processing with their capability to comprehend and generate 
      textual content, showing great potential to play a role in medical education. 
      This study aimed to quantitatively evaluate and comprehensively analysis the 
      performance of ChatGPT on three types of national medical examinations in China, 
      including National Medical Licensing Examination (NMLE), National Pharmacist 
      Licensing Examination (NPLE), and National Nurse Licensing Examination (NNLE). 
      METHODS: We collected questions from Chinese NMLE, NPLE and NNLE from year 2017 
      to 2021. In NMLE and NPLE, each exam consists of 4 units, while in NNLE, each 
      exam consists of 2 units. The questions with figures, tables or chemical 
      structure were manually identified and excluded by clinician. We applied direct 
      instruction strategy via multiple prompts to force ChatGPT to generate the clear 
      answer with the capability to distinguish between single-choice and 
      multiple-choice questions. RESULTS: ChatGPT failed to pass the accuracy threshold 
      of 0.6 in any of the three types of examinations over the five years. 
      Specifically, in the NMLE, the highest recorded accuracy was 0.5467, which was 
      attained in both 2018 and 2021. In the NPLE, the highest accuracy was 0.5599 in 
      2017. In the NNLE, the most impressive result was shown in 2017, with an accuracy 
      of 0.5897, which is also the highest accuracy in our entire evaluation. ChatGPT's 
      performance showed no significant difference in different units, but significant 
      difference in different question types. ChatGPT performed well in a range of 
      subject areas, including clinical epidemiology, human parasitology, and 
      dermatology, as well as in various medical topics such as molecules, health 
      management and prevention, diagnosis and screening. CONCLUSIONS: These results 
      indicate ChatGPT failed the NMLE, NPLE and NNLE in China, spanning from year 2017 
      to 2021. but show great potential of large language models in medical education. 
      In the future high-quality medical data will be required to improve the 
      performance.

TI  - Distinguishing Authentic Voices in the Age of ChatGPT: Comparing AI-Generated and 
      Applicant-Written Personal Statements for Plastic Surgery Residency Application.
PG  - 324-325
LID - 10.1097/SAP.0000000000003653 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: ChatGPT, a generative artificial intelligence model, may be used by 
      future applicants in the plastic surgery residency match. METHODS: Ten personal 
      statements (5 generated by ChatGPT, 5 written by applicants) were rated by 10 
      reviewers, blinded to the source of the essay. RESULTS: A total of a 100 
      evaluations were collected. There was no significant difference in ratings for 
      readability, originality, authenticity, and overall quality (all P &gt; 0.05) when 
      comparing computer-generated and applicant essays. CONCLUSION: Personal 
      statements prepared by ChatGPT are indistinguishable from essays written by 
      actual applicants. This finding suggests that the current plastic surgery 
      application format be reevaluated to better aid in holistic evaluation of 
      students.

AB  - Large language models utilizing transformer neural networks and other deep 
      learning architectures demonstrated unprecedented results in many tasks 
      previously accessible only to human intelligence. In this article, we collaborate 
      with ChatGPT, an AI model developed by OpenAI to speculate on the applications of 
      Rapamycin, in the context of Pascal's Wager philosophical argument commonly 
      utilized to justify the belief in god. In response to the query "Write an 
      exhaustive research perspective on why taking Rapamycin may be more beneficial 
      than not taking Rapamycin from the perspective of Pascal's wager" ChatGPT 
      provided the pros and cons for the use of Rapamycin considering the preclinical 
      evidence of potential life extension in animals. This article demonstrates the 
      potential of ChatGPT to produce complex philosophical arguments and should not be 
      used for any off-label use of Rapamycin.

TI  - Assessing the Performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on the 2023 Japanese Nursing 
      Examination.
PG  - e42924
LID - 10.7759/cureus.42924 [doi]
LID - e42924
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate the changes in capabilities 
      between the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)-3.5 and GPT-4 versions of 
      the large-scale language model ChatGPT within a Japanese medical context. Methods 
      The study involved ChatGPT versions 3.5 and 4 responding to questions from the 
      112th Japanese National Nursing Examination (JNNE). The study comprised three 
      analyses: correct answer rate and score rate calculations, comparisons between 
      GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and comparisons of correct answer rates for conversation 
      questions. Results ChatGPT versions 3.5 and 4 responded to 237 out of 238 
      Japanese questions from the 112th JNNE. While GPT-3.5 achieved an overall 
      accuracy rate of 59.9%, failing to meet the passing standards in compulsory and 
      general/scenario-based questions, scoring 58.0% and 58.3%, respectively, GPT-4 
      had an accuracy rate of 79.7%, satisfying the passing standards by scoring 90.0% 
      and 77.7%, respectively. For each problem type, GPT-4 showed a higher accuracy 
      rate than GPT-3.5. Specifically, the accuracy rates for compulsory questions 
      improved from 58.0% with GPT-3.5 to 90.0% with GPT-4. For general questions, the 
      rates went from 64.6% with GPT-3.5 to 75.6% with GPT-4. In scenario-based 
      questions, the accuracy rates improved substantially from 51.7% with GPT-3.5 to 
      80.0% with GPT-4. For conversation questions, GPT-3.5 had an accuracy rate of 
      73.3% and GPT-4 had an accuracy rate of 93.3%. Conclusions The GPT-4 version of 
      ChatGPT displayed performance sufficient to pass the JNNE, significantly 
      improving from GPT-3.5. This suggests specialized medical training could make 
      such models beneficial in Japanese clinical settings, aiding decision-making. 
      However, user awareness and training are crucial, given potential inaccuracies in 
      ChatGPT's responses. Hence, responsible usage with an understanding of its 
      capabilities and limitations is vital to best support healthcare professionals 
      and patients.

AB  - The attainment of academic superiority relies heavily upon the accessibility of 
      scholarly resources and the expression of research findings through faultless 
      language usage. Although modern tools, such as the Publish or Perish software 
      program, are proficient in sourcing academic papers based on specific keywords, 
      they often fall short of extracting comprehensive content, including crucial 
      references. The challenge of linguistic precision remains a prominent issue, 
      particularly for research papers composed by non-native English speakers who may 
      encounter word usage errors. This manuscript serves a twofold purpose: firstly, 
      it reassesses the effectiveness of ChatGPT-4 in the context of retrieving 
      pertinent references tailored to specific research topics. Secondly, it 
      introduces a suite of language editing services that are skilled in rectifying 
      word usage errors, ensuring the refined presentation of research outcomes. The 
      article also provides practical guidelines for formulating precise queries to 
      mitigate the risks of erroneous language usage and the inclusion of spurious 
      references. In the ever-evolving realm of academic discourse, leveraging the 
      potential of advanced AI, such as ChatGPT-4, can significantly enhance the 
      quality and impact of scientific publications.

TI  - Validity of the large language model ChatGPT (GPT4) as a patient information 
      source in otolaryngology by a variety of doctors in a tertiary 
      otorhinolaryngology department.
PG  - 779-782
LID - 10.1080/00016489.2023.2254809 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A high number of patients seek health information online, and large 
      language models (LLMs) may produce a rising amount of it. AIM: This study 
      evaluates the performance regarding health information provided by ChatGPT, a LLM 
      developed by OpenAI, focusing on its utility as a source for 
      otolaryngology-related patient information. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A variety of 
      doctors from a tertiary otorhinolaryngology department used a Likert scale to 
      assess the chatbot's responses in terms of accuracy, relevance, and depth. The 
      responses were also evaluated by ChatGPT. RESULTS: The composite mean of the 
      three categories was 3.41, with the highest performance noted in the relevance 
      category (mean = 3.71) when evaluated by the respondents. The accuracy and depth 
      categories yielded mean scores of 3.51 and 3.00, respectively. All the categories 
      were rated as 5 when evaluated by ChatGPT. CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: Despite 
      its potential in providing relevant and accurate medical information, the 
      chatbot's responses lacked depth and were found to potentially perpetuate biases 
      due to its training on publicly available text. In conclusion, while LLMs show 
      promise in healthcare, further refinement is necessary to enhance response depth 
      and mitigate potential biases.

TI  - Evaluating the Accuracy of ChatGPT and Google BARD in Fielding Oculoplastic 
      Patient Queries: A Comparative Study on Artificial versus Human Intelligence.
LID - 10.1097/IOP.0000000000002567 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study evaluates and compares the accuracy of responses from 2 
      artificial intelligence platforms to patients' oculoplastics-related questions. 
      METHODS: Questions directed toward oculoplastic surgeons were collected, 
      rephrased, and input independently into ChatGPT-3.5 and BARD chatbots, using the 
      prompt: "As an oculoplastic surgeon, how can I respond to my patient's 
      question?." Responses were independently evaluated by 4 experienced oculoplastic 
      specialists as comprehensive, correct but inadequate, mixed correct and 
      incorrect/outdated data, and completely incorrect. Additionally, the empathy 
      level, length, and automated readability index of the responses were assessed. 
      RESULTS: A total of 112 patient questions underwent evaluation. The rates of 
      comprehensive, correct but inadequate, mixed, and completely incorrect answers 
      for ChatGPT were 71.4%, 12.9%, 10.5%, and 5.1%, respectively, compared with 
      53.1%, 18.3%, 18.1%, and 10.5%, respectively, for BARD. ChatGPT showed more 
      empathy (48.9%) than BARD (13.2%). All graders found that ChatGPT outperformed 
      BARD in question categories of postoperative healing, medical eye conditions, and 
      medications. Categorizing questions by anatomy, ChatGPT excelled in answering 
      lacrimal questions (83.8%), while BARD performed best in the eyelid group 
      (60.4%). ChatGPT's answers were longer and potentially more challenging to 
      comprehend than BARD's. CONCLUSION: This study emphasizes the promising role of 
      artificial intelligence-powered chatbots in oculoplastic patient education and 
      support. With continued development, these chatbots may potentially assist 
      physicians and offer patients accurate information, ultimately contributing to 
      improved patient care while alleviating surgeon burnout. However, it is crucial 
      to highlight that artificial intelligence may be good at answering questions, but 
      physician oversight remains essential to ensure the highest standard of care and 
      address complex medical cases.

TI  - ChatGPT Chemistry Assistant for Text Mining and the Prediction of MOF Synthesis.
PG  - 18048-18062
LID - 10.1021/jacs.3c05819 [doi]
AB  - We use prompt engineering to guide ChatGPT in the automation of text mining of 
      metal-organic framework (MOF) synthesis conditions from diverse formats and 
      styles of the scientific literature. This effectively mitigates ChatGPT's 
      tendency to hallucinate information, an issue that previously made the use of 
      large language models (LLMs) in scientific fields challenging. Our approach 
      involves the development of a workflow implementing three different processes for 
      text mining, programmed by ChatGPT itself. All of them enable parsing, searching, 
      filtering, classification, summarization, and data unification with different 
      trade-offs among labor, speed, and accuracy. We deploy this system to extract 
      26â¯257 distinct synthesis parameters pertaining to approximately 800 MOFs sourced 
      from peer-reviewed research articles. This process incorporates our ChemPrompt 
      Engineering strategy to instruct ChatGPT in text mining, resulting in impressive 
      precision, recall, and F1 scores of 90-99%. Furthermore, with the data set built 
      by text mining, we constructed a machine-learning model with over 87% accuracy in 
      predicting MOF experimental crystallization outcomes and preliminarily 
      identifying important factors in MOF crystallization. We also developed a 
      reliable data-grounded MOF chatbot to answer questions about chemical reactions 
      and synthesis procedures. Given that the process of using ChatGPT reliably mines 
      and tabulates diverse MOF synthesis information in a unified format while using 
      only narrative language requiring no coding expertise, we anticipate that our 
      ChatGPT Chemistry Assistant will be very useful across various other chemistry 
      subdisciplines.

      intelligence and cancer information.
LID - 10.1093/jncics/pkad015 [doi]
LID - pkad015
AB  - Data about the quality of cancer information that chatbots and other artificial 
      intelligence systems provide are limited. Here, we evaluate the accuracy of 
      cancer information on ChatGPT compared with the National Cancer Institute's 
      (NCI's) answers by using the questions on the "Common Cancer Myths and 
      Misconceptions" web page. The NCI's answers and ChatGPT answers to each question 
      were blinded, and then evaluated for accuracy (accurate: yes vs no). Ratings were 
      evaluated independently for each question, and then compared between the blinded 
      NCI and ChatGPT answers. Additionally, word count and Flesch-Kincaid readability 
      grade level for each individual response were evaluated. Following expert review, 
      the percentage of overall agreement for accuracy was 100% for NCI answers and 
      96.9% for ChatGPT outputs for questions 1 through 13 (Ä¸â=ââ0.03, standard 
      errorâ=â0.08). There were few noticeable differences in the number of words or 
      the readability of the answers from NCI or ChatGPT. Overall, the results suggest 
      that ChatGPT provides accurate information about common cancer myths and 
      misconceptions.

TI  - ChatGPT's innovative application in blood morphology recognition.
PG  - 428-433
LID - 10.1097/JCMA.0000000000001071 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, the rapid advancement in generative artificial intelligence 
      (AI) technology, such as ChatGPT-4, has sparked discussions, particularly in 
      image recognition. Accurate results are critical for hematological diagnosis, 
      particularly for blood morphology identification. Despite advanced hematology 
      analyzers, reliance on professional hematopathologists for manual identification 
      remains in cases of abnormal or rare conditions, a process prone to human 
      subjectivity and potential errors. Consequently, this study aimed to investigate 
      the potential of ChatGPT-4 to assist with blood morphology identification. 
      METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study using blood images obtained from the 
      American Society of Hematology (ASH). These images comprised a range of normal 
      and abnormal morphologies. Each sample was analyzed by expert technicians 
      (control group) and classified using ChatGPT-4 (test group). RESULTS: Preliminary 
      results showed that ChatGPT-4 could identify normal blood cells with an accuracy 
      of 88%, exceeding the accuracy of identifying abnormal blood cells at a rate of 
      54%. Regarding identifying abnormal cells, the accuracy of ChatGPT-4 was slightly 
      higher than that of the manual method, which was 49.5%. CONCLUSION: This study 
      shows that although generative AI shows the potential for blood type 
      identification, it has not yet reached the point where it can replace the 
      professional judgment of medical staff. The results showed that ChatGPT-4 is 
      excellent for identifying red blood cell morphology, particularly inclusion 
      bodies. It can be used as an auxiliary tool for clinical diagnosis. However, the 
      overall recognition accuracy must be further improved. Our study produced 
      innovative results in this field, establishing a foundation for future studies 
      and highlighting the potential of generative AI in aiding blood morphology 
      recognition. Future research should focus on enhancing the effectiveness of AI to 
      improve overall standards of medical care.

TI  - Utilizing ChatGPT-4 for Providing Information on Periodontal Disease to Patients: 
      A DISCERN Quality Analysis.
PG  - e46213
LID - 10.7759/cureus.46213 [doi]
LID - e46213
AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to their ability to mimic human responses, anthropomorphic 
      entities such as ChatGPT have a higher likelihood of gaining people's trust. This 
      study aimed to evaluate the quality of information generated by ChatGPT-4, as an 
      artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot, on periodontal disease (PD) using the 
      DISCERN instrument. METHODS: Using Google Bard, the topics related to PD that had 
      the highest search volume according to Google Trends were identified. An 
      interactive dialogue was created by placing the topics in the standard question 
      pattern. As a patient with PD, detailed information was requested from ChatGPT-4 
      regarding the relevant topics. The 'regenerate response' feature was not 
      employed, and the initial response generated by ChatGPT-4 was carefully 
      considered for each topic as new prompts in the form of questions were entered. 
      The response to each question was independently assessed and rated by two 
      experienced raters using the DISCERN instrument. RESULTS: Based on the total 
      DISCERN scores, the qualities of the responses generated by ChatGPT-4 were 
      'good', except for the two responses that rater-2 scored as 'fair'. It was also 
      observed that the 'treatment choices' section of both raters had significantly 
      fewer scores than the other sections. In both weighted kappa and Krippendorff 
      alpha measures, the strength of agreement varied from 'substantial' to 
      'almost-perfect', and the correlation between values was statistically 
      significant. CONCLUSION: Despite some limitations in providing complete treatment 
      choice information according to the DISCERN instrument, it is considered valuable 
      for PD patients seeking information, as it consistently offered accurate guidance 
      in the majority of responses.

TI  - Assessment of the Responses of the Artificial Intelligence-based Chatbot 
      ChatGPT-4 to Frequently Asked Questions About Amblyopia and Childhood Myopia.
PG  - 86-89
LID - 10.3928/01913913-20231005-02 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the responses of the ChatGPT-4, the forerunner artificial 
      intelligence-based chatbot, to frequently asked questions regarding two common 
      pediatric ophthalmologic disorders, amblyopia and childhood myopia. METHODS: 
      Twenty-seven questions about amblyopia and 28 questions about childhood myopia 
      were asked of the ChatGPT twice (totally 110 questions). The responses were 
      evaluated by two pediatric ophthalmologists as acceptable, incomplete, or 
      unacceptable. RESULTS: There was remarkable agreement (96.4%) between the two 
      pediatric ophthalmologists on their assessment of the responses. Acceptable 
      responses were provided by the ChatGPT to 93 of 110 (84.6%) questions in total 
      (44 of 54 [81.5%] for amblyopia and 49 of 56 [87.5%] questions for childhood 
      myopia). Seven of 54 (12.9%) responses to questions on amblyopia were graded as 
      incomplete compared to 4 of 56 (7.1%) of questions on childhood myopia. The 
      ChatGPT gave inappropriate responses to three questions about amblyopia (5.6%) 
      and childhood myopia (5.4%). The most noticeable inappropriate responses were 
      related to the definition of reverse amblyopia and the threshold of refractive 
      error for prescription of spectacles to children with myopia. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an adjunct informational tool for pediatric 
      ophthalmology patients and their caregivers by demonstrating a relatively good 
      performance in answering 84.6% of the most frequently asked questions about 
      amblyopia and childhood myopia. [J Pediatr Ophthalmol Strabismus.

TI  - ChatGPT for Automated Cross-Checking of Authors' Conflicts of Interest Against 
      Industry Payments.
LID - 10.1002/ohn.720 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services "OpenPayments" database 
      tracks industry payments to US physicians to improve research conflicts of 
      interest (COIs) transparency, but manual cross-checking of articles' authors 
      against this database is labor-intensive. This study aims to assess the potential 
      of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to automate COI data analysis in 
      medical publications. STUDY DESIGN: An observational study analyzing the accuracy 
      of ChatGPT in automating the cross-checking of COI disclosures in medical 
      research articles against the OpenPayments database. SETTING: Publications 
      regarding Food and Drug Administration-approved biologics for chronic 
      rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis: omalizumab, mepolizumab, and dupilumab. 
      METHODS: First, ChatGPT evaluated author affiliations from PubMed to identify 
      those based in the United States. Second, for author names matching 1 or multiple 
      payment recipients in OpenPayments, ChatGPT undertook a comparative analysis 
      between author affiliation and OpenPayments recipient metadata. Third, ChatGPT 
      scrutinized full article COI statements, producing an intricate matrix of 
      disclosures for each author against each relevant company (Sanofi, Regeneron, 
      Genentech, Novartis, and GlaxoSmithKline). A random subset of responses was 
      manually checked for accuracy. RESULTS: In total, 78 relevant articles and 294 
      unique US authors were included, leading to 980 LLM queries. Manual verification 
      showed accuracies of 100% (200/200; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 98.1%-100%) for 
      country analysis, 97.4% (113/116; 95% CI: 92.7%-99.1%) for matching author 
      affiliations with OpenPayments metadata, and 99.2% (1091/1100; 95% CI: 
      98.5%-99.6%) for COI statement data extraction. CONCLUSION: LLMs have robust 
      potential to automate author-company-specific COI cross-checking against the 
      OpenPayments database. Our findings pave the way for streamlined, efficient, and 
      accurate COI assessment that could be widely employed across medical research.

AB  - ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a chat robot program 
      developed by OpenAI (OpenAI Incorporated, Mission District, San Francisco, USA). 
      It is a natural-language processing tool driven by artificial intelligence 
      technology. It can complete tasks such as writing emails, video scripts, 
      copywriting, translation, coding, and writing papers. At present, several studies 
      have been conducted on the use of this tool for academic writing, so we report a 
      rare case of suprasellar ectopic pituitary neuroendocrine tumor (PitNET) 
      secreting growth hormones, in a female 53-year-old patient with facial changes 
      and hypertrophy of her hands and feet for six years. When asking questions on 
      unusual topics, ChatGPT can provide answers but not specific ones, and similar to 
      most machine learning solutions, verifying the correctness of information is&nbsp;a 
      problem. Question asked from ChatGPT: Summarize ectopic pituitary neuroendocrine 
      tumor. "Suprasellar heterotopic pituitary neuroendocrine tumors refer to tumors 
      formed by the heterotopic growth of pituitary neuroendocrine tumor cells in the 
      sellar region other than the pituitary glands. This tumor is common in 
      middle-aged women, and it often manifests as headache, visual impairment, and 
      endocrine dysfunction. Diagnosis is usually made by combining history, physical 
      examination, blood tests, and imaging. Treatment is primarily performed through 
      surgical resection of the tumor, radiotherapy, and drug therapy, and the 
      prognosis is mostly good." The content in quotation marks is generated by 
      ChatGPT.

      cross-sectional study.
PG  - e63493
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.63493 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The precision medicine era has seen increased utilization of artificial 
      intelligence (AI) in the field of genetics. We sought to explore the ways that 
      genetic counselors (GCs) currently use the publicly accessible AI tool Chat 
      Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) in their work. METHODS: GCs in North 
      America were surveyed about how ChatGPT is used in different aspects of their 
      work. Descriptive statistics were reported through frequencies and means. 
      RESULTS: Of 118 GCs who completed the survey, 33.8% (40) reported using ChatGPT 
      in their work; 47.5% (19) use it in clinical practice, 35% (14) use it in 
      education, and 32.5% (13) use it in research. Most GCs (62.7%; 74) felt that it 
      saves time on administrative tasks but the majority (82.2%; 97) felt that a 
      paramount challenge was the risk of obtaining incorrect information. The majority 
      of GCs not using ChatGPT (58.9%; 46) felt it was not necessary for their work. 
      CONCLUSION: A considerable number of GCs in the field are using ChatGPT in 
      different ways, but it is primarily helpful with tasks that involve writing. It 
      has potential to streamline workflow issues encountered in clinical genetics, but 
      practitioners need to be informed and uniformly trained about its limitations.

TI  - ChatGPT performance in the medical specialty exam: An observational study.
PG  - e34673
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000034673 [doi]
LID - e34673
AB  - In our study, we aimed to evaluate the success of ChatGPT by determining its 
      performance in the last 5 medical specialty exams (MSE) conducted and its ranking 
      among the candidates of that year, and to determine its potential use in 
      healthcare services. Publicly available MSE questions and answer keys from the 
      last 5 years were scanned, a total of 1177 questions were included in the study, 
      all questions were asked to the ChatGPT (OpenAI; San Francisco, CA) GPT-3.5 
      series, which is the March 23, 2023 version. The average score and rank that 
      ChatGPT would receive if it had entered the exam that year were determined. 
      Questions were categorized as short question group, long question group, single 
      select multiple-choice questions, and multi-select multiple-choice questions. The 
      lowest success proportion was determined as 54.3%, and the highest success 
      proportion was 70.9% correct answer percentage. It achieved a sufficient result 
      as 1787th out of 22,214 people in its most successful exam, and 4428th out of 
      21,476 participants in its least successful one. No statistically significant 
      difference was found between the correct answers it gave to clinical and basic 
      science questions (P: .66). ChatGPT statistically significantly answered a higher 
      proportion of questions correctly in the short questions group compared to the 
      long questions group (P = .03), and in the single select multiple choice 
      questions group compared to the multi-select multiple choice questions group (P &lt; 
      .001). ChatGPT has been successful in the MSE, a challenging exam for doctors in 
      our country. However, it is a fact that ChatGPT is still behind the expert in the 
      field for now, and what will happen with program developments in the future is a 
      matter of curiosity for all of us.

PG  - 4687-4689
LID - 10.1007/s00405-023-08135-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical decision-making has 
      once again come to the forefront with the prevalence of Natural Language 
      Processing (NLP). In this exploratory article, we tested one such model, ChatGPT, 
      for its ability to identify vestibular causes of dizziness METHODS: Eight 
      hypothetical scenarios were presented to ChatGPT, which included varying clinical 
      pictures and types of prompts. The responses given by ChatGPT were evaluated for 
      coherence, clarity, consistency, accuracy, appropriateness, and recognition of 
      limitations. ChatGPT provided coherent and logical responses. RESULTS: The model 
      accurately provided differentials for both vestibular and non-vestibular causes 
      of dizziness, with the correct diagnosis presented first in six of the cases, 
      with important limitations CONCLUSION: Being an AI tool, ChatGPT lacks the 
      ability to process certain nuances in clinical decision making, in both 
      identifying atypical dizziness, as well as in recommending further examination 
      steps to elucidate a clearer diagnosis. We believe that AI will continue to forge 
      ahead in the medical field. Merging the immense knowledge base of AI programming 
      with the nuances of clinical assessment and knowledge integration will surely 
      enhance patient care in the years to come.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) tools, like OpenAI's Chat Generative Pre-trained 
      Transformer (ChatGPT), hold considerable potential in healthcare, academia, and 
      diverse industries. Evidence demonstrates its capability at a medical student 
      level in standardized tests, suggesting utility in medical education, radiology 
      reporting, genetics research, data optimization, and drafting repetitive texts 
      such as discharge summaries. Nevertheless, these tools should augment, not 
      supplant, human expertise. Despite promising applications, ChatGPT confronts 
      limitations, including critical thinking tasks and generating false references, 
      necessitating stringent cross-verification. Ensuing concerns, such as potential 
      misuse, bias, blind trust, and privacy, underscore the need for transparency, 
      accountability, and clear policies. Evaluations of AI-generated content and 
      preservation of academic integrity are critical. With responsible use, AI can 
      significantly improve healthcare, academia, and industry without compromising 
      integrity and research quality. For effective and ethical AI deployment, 
      collaboration amongst AI developers, researchers, educators, and policymakers is 
      vital. The development of domain-specific tools, guidelines, regulations, and the 
      facilitation of public dialogue must underpin these endeavors to responsibly 
      harness AI's potential.

AB  - The release of text-generating applications based on interactive Large Language 
      Models (LLMs) in late 2022 triggered an unprecedented and ever-growing interest 
      worldwide. The almost instantaneous success of LLMs stimulated lively discussions 
      in public media and in academic fora alike not only on the value and potentials 
      of such tools in all areas of knowledge and information acquisition and 
      distribution but also on the dangers posed by their uncontrolled and 
      indiscriminate use. This conversation is now particularly active in the higher 
      education sector, where LLMs are seen as a potential threat to academic integrity 
      at all levels, from facilitating cheating by students in assignments to 
      plagiarizing academic writing in the case of researchers and administrators. 
      Within this framework, we are interested in testing the boundaries of the LLM 
      ChatGPT (www.openai.com) in areas of our scientific interest and expertise and in 
      analyzing the results from different perspectives, i.e. of a final year BSc 
      student, of a research scientist, and of a lecturer in higher education. To this 
      end, in this paper, we present and discuss a systematic evaluation on how ChatGPT 
      addresses progressively complex scientific writing tasks and exam-type questions 
      in Carbohydrate Chemistry and Glycobiology. The results of this project allowed 
      us to gain insight on: (i) the strengths and limitations of the ChatGPT model to 
      provide relevant and (most importantly) correct scientific information, (ii) the 
      format(s) and complexity of the query required to obtain the desired output, and 
      (iii) strategies to integrate LLMs in teaching and learning.

AB  - The generative pre-trained transformer, ChatGPT, is a chatbot that could serve as 
      a powerful tool in scientific writing. ChatGPT is a so-called large language 
      model (LLM) that is trained to mimic the statistical patterns of language in an 
      enormous database of human-generated text combined from text in books, articles 
      and websites across a wide range of domains. ChatGPT can assist scientists with 
      material organization, draft creation and proofreading, making it a valuable tool 
      in research and publishing. This paper discusses the use of this artificial 
      intelligence (AI) chatbot in academic writing by presenting one simplified 
      example. Specifically, it reflects our experience of using ChatGPT to draft a 
      scientific article for Reproductive BioMedicine Online and highlights the pros, 
      cons and concerns associated with using LLM-based AI for generating a manuscript.

LID - 10.1097/NNE.0000000000001390 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence-driven, pretrained, deep learning 
      language model, can generate natural language text in response to a given query. 
      Its rapid growth has led to concerns about ethical use in academia. PROBLEM: The 
      exponential rise in the popularity of ChatGPT, and concerns of academic integrity 
      with its use, has raised concerns among faculty for how to best address this 
      issue. APPROACH: Faculty should understand the potential benefits and limitations 
      of ChatGPT and create assignments that emphasize self-reflection, critical 
      thinking, problem solving, and independent learning. Students must be taught how 
      to critically evaluate information and how to make informed decisions. 
      CONCLUSIONS: ChatGPT has the potential to revolutionize nursing education. 
      However, it is critical for faculty to be familiar with its capabilities and 
      limitations in order to foster effective, yet ethical and responsible 
      utilization, while preparing students for the dynamic, rapidly advancing 
      technological landscape in nursing and health care.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chat-GPT is rapidly emerging as a promising and potentially 
      revolutionary tool in medicine. One of its possible applications is the 
      stratification of patients according to the severity of clinical conditions and 
      prognosis during the triage evaluation in the emergency department (ED). METHODS: 
      Using a randomly selected sample of 30 vignettes recreated from real clinical 
      cases, we compared the concordance in risk stratification of ED patients between 
      healthcare personnel and Chat-GPT. The concordance was assessed with Cohen's 
      kappa, and the performance was evaluated with the area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curve (AUROC) curves. Among the outcomes, we considered 
      mortality within 72&nbsp;h, the need for hospitalization, and the presence of a severe 
      or time-dependent condition. RESULTS: The concordance in triage code assignment 
      between triage nurses and Chat-GPT was 0.278 (unweighted Cohen's kappa; 95% 
      confidence intervals: 0.231-0.388). For all outcomes, the ROC values were higher 
      for the triage nurses. The most relevant difference was found in 72-h mortality, 
      where triage nurses showed an AUROC of 0.910 (0.757-1.000) compared to only 0.669 
      (0.153-1.000) for Chat-GPT. CONCLUSIONS: The current level of Chat-GPT 
      reliability is insufficient to make it a valid substitute for the expertise of 
      triage nurses in prioritizing ED patients. Further developments are required to 
      enhance the safety and effectiveness of AI for risk stratification of ED 
      patients.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence Language Model Performance for Rapid Intraoperative 
      Queries in Plastic Surgery: ChatGPT and the Deep Inferior Epigastric Perforator 
      Flap.
LID - 10.3390/jcm13030900 [doi]
LID - 900
AB  - Background: The integration of artificial intelligence in healthcare has led to 
      the development of large language models that can address various medical 
      queries, including intraoperatively. This study investigates the potential of 
      ChatGPT in addressing intraoperative questions during the deep inferior 
      epigastric perforator flap procedure. Methods: A series of six intraoperative 
      questions specific to the DIEP flap procedure, derived from real-world clinical 
      scenarios, were proposed to ChatGPT. A panel of four experienced board-certified 
      plastic surgeons evaluated ChatGPT's performance in providing accurate, relevant, 
      and comprehensible responses. Results: The Likert scale demonstrated to be 
      medically accurate, systematic in presentation, and logical when providing 
      alternative solutions. The mean readability score of the Flesch Reading Ease 
      Score was 28.7 (Â±0.8), the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level was 12.4 (Â±0.5), and the 
      Coleman-Liau Index was 14.5 (Â±0.5). Suitability-wise, the DISCERN score of 
      ChatGPT was 48 (Â±2.5) indicating suitable and comprehensible language for 
      experts. Conclusions: Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT can serve as a 
      supplementary tool for surgeons to offer valuable insights and foster 
      intraoperative problem-solving abilities. However, it lacks consideration of 
      individual patient factors and surgical nuances. Nevertheless, further refinement 
      of its training data and rigorous scrutiny under experts to ensure the accuracy 
      and up-to-date nature of the information holds the potential for it to be 
      utilized in the surgical field.

TI  - Assessing ChatGPT's Proficiency in Simplifying Radiological Reports for 
      Healthcare Professionals&nbsp;and&nbsp;Patients.
PG  - e50881
LID - 10.7759/cureus.50881 [doi]
LID - e50881
AB  - Background Clear communication of radiological findings is crucial for effective 
      healthcare decision-making. However, radiological reports are often complex with 
      technical terminology, making them challenging for non-radiology healthcare 
      professionals and patients to comprehend.&nbsp;Large language models like ChatGPT 
      (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer, by OpenAI, San Francisco, CA) offer a 
      potential solution by translating intricate reports into simplified language. 
      This study aimed to assess the capability of ChatGPT-3.5 in simplifying 
      radiological reports to facilitate improved understanding by healthcare 
      professionals and patients. Materials and methods Nine radiological reports were 
      taken for this study spanning various imaging modalities and medical conditions. 
      These reports were used to ask ChatGPT a set of seven questions (describe the 
      procedure, mention the key findings, express in a simple language, suggestions 
      for further investigation, need of further investigation, grammatical or typing 
      errors, and translation into Hindi). A total of eight radiologists rated the 
      generated content in detailing, summarizing, simplifying content and language, 
      factual correctness, further investigation, grammatical errors, and translation 
      to Hindi. Results The highest score was obtained for detailing the report (94.17% 
      accuracy) and the lowest score was for drawing conclusions for the patient (85% 
      accuracy); case-wise scores were similar (p-value = 0.97). The Hindi translation 
      by ChatGPT was not suitable for patient communication. Conclusion The current 
      free version of ChatGPT-3.5 was able to simplify radiological reports 
      effectively, removing technical jargon while preserving essential diagnostic 
      information. The free version adeptly simplifies radiological reports, enhancing 
      accessibility for healthcare professionals and patients. Hence, it has the 
      potential to enhance medical communication, facilitating informed decision-making 
      by healthcare professionals and patients.

TI  - ChatGPT in Answering Queries Related to Lifestyle-Related Diseases and Disorders.
PG  - e48296
LID - 10.7759/cureus.48296 [doi]
LID - e48296
AB  - Background Lifestyle-related diseases and disorders have become a significant 
      global health burden. However, the majority of the population ignores or do not 
      consult doctors for such disease or disorders. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based 
      large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT (GPT3.5) is capable of generating 
      customized queries of a user. Hence, it can act as a virtual telehealth agent. 
      Its capability to answer lifestyle-related diseases or disorders has not been 
      explored. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of ChatGPT, an 
      LLM, in providing answers to queries related to lifestyle-related diseases or 
      disorders. Methods A set of 20 lifestyle-related disease or disorder cases 
      covering a wide range of topics such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular health, 
      and mental health were prepared with four questions. The case and questions were 
      presented to ChatGPT and asked for the answers to those questions. Two physicians 
      rated the content on a three-point Likert-like scale ranging from accurate (2), 
      partially accurate (1), and inaccurate (0). Further, the content was rated as 
      adequate (2), inadequate (1), and misguiding (0) for testing the applicability of 
      the guides for patients. The readability of the text was analyzed by the 
      Flesch-Kincaid Ease Score (FKES).&nbsp; Results Among 20 cases, the average score of 
      accuracy was 1.83Â±0.37 and guidance was 1.9Â±0.21. Both the scores were higher 
      than the hypothetical median of 1.5 (p=0.004&nbsp;and p&lt;0.0001, respectively). ChatGPT 
      answered the questions with a natural tone in 11 cases and nine with a positive 
      tone. The text was understandable for college graduates with a mean FKES of 
      27.8Â±5.74. Conclusion The analysis of content accuracy revealed that ChatGPT 
      provided reasonably accurate information in the majority of the cases, 
      successfully addressing queries related to lifestyle-related diseases or 
      disorders. Hence, initial guidance can be obtained by patients when they get 
      little time to consult a doctor or wait for an appointment to consult a doctor 
      for suggestions about their condition.

TI  - The Quality of CLP-Related Information for Patients Provided by ChatGPT.
PG  - 10556656231222387
LID - 10.1177/10556656231222387 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the quality, reliability, readability, and similarity of the 
      data that a recently created NLP-based artificial intelligence model ChatGPT 4 
      provides to users in Cleft Lip and Palate (CLP)-related information. DESIGN: In 
      the evaluation of the responses provided by the OpenAI ChatGPT to the CLP-related 
      50 questions, several tools were utilized, including the Ensuring Quality 
      Information for Patients (EQIP) tool, Reliability Scoring System (Adapted from 
      DISCERN), Flesh Reading Ease Formula (FRES) and Flesch-Kinkaid Reading Grade 
      Level (FKRGL) formulas, Global Quality Scale (GQS), and Similarity Index with 
      plagiarism-detection tool. Jamovi (The Jamovi Project, 2022, version 2.3; Sydney, 
      Australia) software was used for all statistical analyses. RESULTS: Based on the 
      reliability and GQS values, ChatGPT demonstrated high reliability and good 
      quality attributable to CLP. Furthermore, according to the FRES results, 
      ChatGPT's readability is difficult, and the similarity index values of this 
      software exhibit an acceptable level of similarity ratio. There is no significant 
      difference in EQIP, Reliability Score System, FRES, FKGRL, GQS, and Similarity 
      Index values among the two categories. CONCLUSION: OpenAI ChatGPT provides a 
      highly reliable, high-quality, but challenging to read, and acceptable similarity 
      rate in providing information related to CLP. Ensuring that information obtained 
      through these models is verified and assessed by a qualified medical expert is 
      crucial.

TI  - Large Language Models and Artificial Intelligence: A Primer for Plastic Surgeons 
      on the Demonstrated and Potential Applications, Promises, and Limitations of 
      ChatGPT.
PG  - 329-343
LID - 10.1093/asj/sjad260 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI) holds 
      great potential for plastic surgeons. ChatGPT, a recently released AI large 
      language model (LLM), promises applications across many disciplines, including 
      healthcare. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this article was to provide a primer for 
      plastic surgeons on AI, LLM, and ChatGPT, including an analysis of current 
      demonstrated and proposed clinical applications. METHODS: A systematic review was 
      performed identifying medical and surgical literature on ChatGPT's proposed 
      clinical applications. Variables assessed included applications investigated, 
      command tasks provided, user input information, AI-emulated human skills, output 
      validation, and reported limitations. RESULTS: The analysis included 175 articles 
      reporting on 13 plastic surgery applications and 116 additional clinical 
      applications, categorized by field and purpose. Thirty-four applications within 
      plastic surgery are thus proposed, with relevance to different target audiences, 
      including attending plastic surgeons (n = 17, 50%), trainees/educators (n = 8, 
      24.0%), researchers/scholars (n = 7, 21%), and patients (n = 2, 6%). The 15 
      identified limitations of ChatGPT were categorized by training data, algorithm, 
      and ethical considerations. CONCLUSIONS: Widespread use of ChatGPT in plastic 
      surgery will depend on rigorous research of proposed applications to validate 
      performance and address limitations. This systemic review aims to guide research, 
      development, and regulation to safely adopt AI in plastic surgery.

TI  - Caution! AI Bot Has Entered the Patient Chat: ChatGPT Has Limitations in 
      Providing Accurate Urologic Healthcare Advice.

LID - S0090-4295(23)00597-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.urology.2023.07.010 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To conduct the first study examining the accuracy of ChatGPT, an 
      artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot, derived patient counseling responses based 
      on clinical care guidelines in urology using a validated questionnaire. METHODS: 
      We asked ChatGPT a set of 13 urological guideline-based questions three times. 
      Answers were evaluated for appropriateness and using Brief DISCERN (BD), a 
      validated healthcare information assessment questionnaire. Data analysis included 
      descriptive statistics and Student's t test (SAS Studio). RESULTS: 60% (115/195) 
      of ChatGPT responses were deemed appropriate. Variability existed between 
      responses to the same prompt, with 25% of the 13 question sets having discordant 
      appropriateness designations. The average BD score was 16.8&nbsp;Â±&nbsp;3.59. Only 7 (54%) 
      of 13 topics and 21 (54%) of 39 responses met the BD cut-off score of â¥16 to 
      denote good-quality content. Appropriateness was associated with higher overall 
      and Relevance domain scores (both P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;.01). The lowest BD domain scores were for 
      Source categories, since ChatGPT does not provide references by default. With 
      prompting, 92.3% had â¥1 incorrect, misinterpreted, or nonfunctional citations. 
      CONCLUSION: While ChatGPT provides appropriate responses to urological questions 
      more than half of the time, it misinterprets clinical care guidelines, dismisses 
      important contextual information, conceals its sources, and provides 
      inappropriate references. Chatbot models hold great promise, but users should be 
      cautious when interpreting healthcare-related advice from existing AI models. 
      Additional training and modifications are needed before these AI models will be 
      ready for reliable use by patients and providers.

LID - 10.3233/SHTI230562 [doi]
AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shown the ability to enhance the accuracy and 
      efficiency of physicians. ChatGPT is an AI chatbot that can interact with humans 
      through text, over the internet. It is trained with machine learning algorithms, 
      using large datasets. In this study, we compare the performance of using a 
      ChatGPT API 3.5 Turbo model to a general model, in assisting urologists in 
      obtaining accurate, valid medical information. The API was accessed through a 
      Python script that was applied specifically for this study based on 2023 EAU 
      guidelines in PDF format. This custom-trained model leads to providing doctors 
      with more precise, prompt answers about specific urologic subjects, thus helping 
      them, ultimately, providing better patient care.

TI  - Performance of ChatGPT on the pharmacist licensing examination in Taiwan.
PG  - 653-658
LID - 10.1097/JCMA.0000000000000942 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence model trained for 
      conversations. ChatGPT has been widely applied in general medical education and 
      cardiology, but its application in pharmacy has been lacking. This study examined 
      the accuracy of ChatGPT on the Taiwanese Pharmacist Licensing Examination and 
      investigated its potential role in pharmacy education. METHODS: ChatGPT was used 
      on the first Taiwanese Pharmacist Licensing Examination in 2023 in Mandarin and 
      English. The questions were entered manually one by one. Graphical questions, 
      chemical formulae, and tables were excluded. Textual questions were scored 
      according to the number of correct answers. Chart question scores were determined 
      by multiplying the number and the correct rate of text questions. This study was 
      conducted from March 5 to March 10, 2023, by using ChatGPT 3.5. RESULTS: The 
      correct rate of ChatGPT in Chinese and English questions was 54.4% and 56.9% in 
      the first stage, and 53.8% and 67.6% in the second stage. On the Chinese test, 
      only pharmacology and pharmacochemistry sections received passing scores. The 
      English test scores were higher than the Chinese test scores across all subjects 
      and were significantly higher in dispensing pharmacy and clinical pharmacy as 
      well as therapeutics. CONCLUSION: ChatGPT 3.5 failed the Taiwanese Pharmacist 
      Licensing Examination. Although it is not able to pass the examination, it can be 
      improved quickly through deep learning. It reminds us that we should not only use 
      multiple-choice questions to assess a pharmacist's ability, but also use more 
      variety of evaluations in the future. Pharmacy education should be changed in 
      line with the examination, and students must be able to use AI technology for 
      self-learning. More importantly, we need to help students develop humanistic 
      qualities and strengthen their ability to interact with patients, so that they 
      can become warm-hearted healthcare professionals.

AB  - The TrollLabs Open dataset includes comprehensive information that offers a 
      comparison of design practices and outcomes between human participants and 
      Generative AI during a hackathon event. The dataset was curated through the 
      running of a prototyping hackathon designed to assess the abilities and 
      performance of generative AI, specifically ChatGPT, in the early stages of 
      engineering design. This assessment involved comparing ChatGPT's performance to 
      that of experienced engineering students in a hackathon setting, where 
      participants competed by making a prototype that fires a NERF dart as far as 
      possible. In this setup, all ideas, concepts, strategies, and actions undertaken 
      by the AI-controlled team were autonomously generated by the ChatGPT, without 
      human intervention or guidance, but implemented by two participants. Five 
      self-directed baseline teams competed against the AI team. The dataset comprises 
      116 prototype entries and 433 edges (connection) that enable comparative analysis 
      of design practices and performance between the team instructed solely by 
      generative AI and baseline teams of experienced engineering design students. 
      Prototypes and their attribute data were captured using Pro2booth, an online 
      prototype capture platform running on participants' phones and computers. The 
      dataset includes a transcript of the conversation between ChatGPT and the team 
      responsible for implementing its recommendations, featuring 97 exchanges of 
      prompts and responses. It contains the initial prompt used to instruct the AI, 
      the objective and rules of the hackathon and the objective performance of teams, 
      showing the ChatGPT team finishing 2(nd) among six teams. To the authors' 
      knowledge, the TrollLabs Open dataset is the first and only open resource that 
      directly compares the performance of generative AI with human teams in an 
      engineering design context. Thus, it is intended to be a valuable resource to 
      design researchers, engineering and design students, educators, and industry 
      professionals seeking to find strategies for implementing generative AI tools in 
      their design processes. By offering a comprehensive data collection, the dataset 
      enables external researchers to conduct in-depth analyses that could highlight 
      the practical implications of integrating generative AI in design practices, 
      possibly providing an overview of its limitations and presenting recommendations 
      for improved integration in the design process.

TI  - Exploring the Role of Artificial Intelligence Chatbots in Preoperative Counseling 
      for Head and Neck Cancer Surgery.
LID - 10.1002/lary.31243 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential use of artificial intelligence (AI) 
      chatbots, such as ChatGPT, in preoperative counseling for patients undergoing 
      head and neck cancer surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-Sectional Survey Study. 
      SETTING: Single institution tertiary care center. METHODS: ChatGPT was used to 
      generate presurgical educational information including indications, risks, and 
      recovery time for five common head and neck surgeries. Chatbot-generated 
      information was compared with information gathered from a simple browser search 
      (first publicly available website excluding scholarly articles). The accuracy of 
      the information, readability, thoroughness, and number of errors were compared by 
      five experienced head and neck surgeons in a blinded fashion. Each surgeon then 
      chose a preference between the two information sources for each surgery. RESULTS: 
      With the exception of total word count, ChatGPT-generated pre-surgical 
      information has similar readability, content of knowledge, accuracy, 
      thoroughness, and numbers of medical errors when compared to publicly available 
      websites. Additionally, ChatGPT was preferred 48% of the time by experienced head 
      and neck surgeons. CONCLUSION: Head and neck surgeons rated ChatGPT-generated and 
      readily available online educational materials similarly. Further refinement in 
      AI technology may soon open more avenues for patient counseling. Future 
      investigations into the medical safety of AI counseling and exploring patients' 
      perspectives would be of strong interest. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: N/A. Laryngoscope,

TI  - Does Google's Bard Chatbot perform better than ChatGPT on the European hand 
      surgery exam?
PG  - 151-158
LID - 10.1007/s00264-023-06034-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: According to a previous research, the chatbot ChatGPTÂ® V3.5 was unable 
      to pass the first part of the European Board of Hand Surgery (EBHS) diploma 
      examination. This study aimed to investigate whether Google's chatbot BardÂ® would 
      have superior performance compared to ChatGPT on the EBHS diploma examination. 
      METHODS: Chatbots were asked to answer 18 EBHS multiple choice questions (MCQs) 
      published in the Journal of Hand Surgery (European Volume) in five trials (A1 to 
      A5). After A3, chatbots received correct answers, and after A4, incorrect 
      answers. Consequently, their ability to modify their response was measured and 
      compared. RESULTS: BardÂ® scored 3/18 (A1), 1/18 (A2), 4/18 (A3) and 2/18 (A4 and 
      A5). The average percentage of correct answers was 61.1% for A1, 62.2% for A2, 
      64.4% for A3, 65.6% for A4, 63.3% for A5 and 63.3% for all trials combined. 
      Agreement was moderate from A1 to A5 (kappaâ=â0.62 (IC95%â=â[0.51; 0.73])) as 
      well as from A1 to A3 (kappaâ=â0.60 (IC95%â=â[0.47; 0.74])). The formulation of 
      BardÂ® responses was homogeneous, but its learning capacity is still developing. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The main hypothesis of our study was not proved since Bard did not 
      score significantly higher than ChatGPT when answering the MCQs of the EBHS 
      diploma exam.&nbsp;In conclusion, neither ChatGPTÂ® nor BardÂ®, in their current 
      versions, can pass the first part of the EBHS diploma exam.

      terminology commonly used in radiology reports based on the recommendation of 
      Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) v2022 from American College of 
      Radiology and Fleischner society. Materials and Methods Forty of the exact same 
      questions were created and presented to ChatGPT-3.5 and Google Bard experimental 
      version as well as Bing and Google search engines by three different authors of 
      this paper. Each answer was reviewed by two radiologists for accuracy. Responses 
      were scored as correct, partially correct, incorrect, or unanswered. Consistency 
      was also evaluated among the answers. Here, consistency was defined as the 
      agreement between the three answers provided by ChatGPT-3.5, Google Bard 
      experimental version, Bing, and Google search engines regardless of whether the 
      concept conveyed was correct or incorrect. The accuracy among different tools 
      were evaluated using Stata. Results ChatGPT-3.5 answered 120 questions with 85 
      (70.8%) correct, 14 (11.7%) partially correct, and 21 (17.5%) incorrect. Google 
      Bard did not answer 23 (19.1%) questions. Among the 97 questions answered by 
      Google Bard, 62 (51.7%) were correct, 11 (9.2%) were partially correct, and 24 
      (20%) were incorrect. Bing answered 120 questions with 74 (61.7%) correct, 13 
      (10.8%) partially correct, and 33 (27.5%) incorrect. Google search engine 
      answered 120 questions with 66 (55%) correct, 27 (22.5%) partially correct, and 
      27 (22.5%) incorrect. The ChatGPT-3.5 is more likely to provide correct or 
      partially answer than Google Bard, approximately by 1.5 folds (OR = 1.55, P = 
      0.004). ChatGPT-3.5 and Google search engine were more likely to be consistent 
      than Google Bard by approximately 7 and 29 folds (OR = 6.65, P = 0.002 for 
      ChatGPT and OR = 28.83, P = 0.002 for Google search engine, respectively). 
      Conclusion Although ChatGPT-3.5 had a higher accuracy in comparison with the 
      other tools, neither ChatGPT nor Google Bard, Bing and Google search engines 
      answered all questions correctly and with 100% consistency.

TI  - The impact of AI and ChatGPT on research reporting.
PG  - 60-64
AB  - ChatGPT and the newest GPT-4 are AI language models developed by OpenAI that have 
      gained attention for their potential applications in biomedical research 
      reporting. The models can assist researchers in various stages of writing 
      scientific articles, including literature search, outlining, writing different 
      sections, formatting, and translation. The use of ChatGPT or GPT-4 in research 
      reporting has the potential to speed up the writing process, but its limitations, 
      such as incorrect answers and biases, should also be considered. There is ongoing 
      debate over the issue of AI authorship in scientific papers, with some publishers 
      allowing it to be listed as a contributor in the acknowledgements section, while 
      others do not allow it to be listed as an author. The use of ChatGPT or GPT-4 in 
      research reporting is a recent development, and further studies and discussions 
      are needed to determine their potential and limitations in this field.

TI  - Artificial intelligence performance in clinical neurology queries: the ChatGPT 
      model.
PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.1080/01616412.2024.2334118 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The use of artificial intelligence technology is progressively 
      expanding and advancing in the health and biomedical literature. Since its 
      launch, ChatGPT has rapidly gained popularity and become one of the 
      fastest-growing artificial intelligence applications in history. This study 
      evaluated the accuracy and comprehensiveness of ChatGPT-generated responses to 
      medical queries in clinical neurology. METHODS: We directed 216 questions from 
      different subspecialties to ChatGPT. The questions were classified into three 
      categories: multiple-choice, descriptive, and binary (yes/no answers). Each 
      question in all categories was subjectively rated as easy, medium, or hard 
      according to its difficulty level. Questions that also tested for intuitive 
      clinical thinking and reasoning ability were evaluated in a separate category. 
      RESULTS: ChatGPT correctly answered 141 questions (65.3%). No significant 
      difference was detected in the accuracy and comprehensiveness scale scores or 
      correct answer rates in comparisons made according to the question style or 
      difficulty level. However, a comparative analysis assessing question 
      characteristics revealed significantly lower accuracy and comprehensiveness scale 
      scores and correct answer rates for questions based on interpretations that 
      required critical thinking (pâ=â0.007, 0.007, and 0.001, respectively). 
      CONCLUSION: ChatGPT had a moderate overall performance in clinical neurology and 
      demonstrated inadequate performance in answering questions that required 
      interpretation and critical thinking. It also displayed limited performance in 
      specific subspecialties. It is essential to acknowledge the limitations of 
      artificial intelligence and diligently verify medical information produced by 
      such models using reliable sources.

TI  - Using ChatGPT-Like Solutions to Bridge the Communication Gap Between Patients 
      With Rheumatoid Arthritis and Health Care Professionals.
PG  - e48989
LID - 10.2196/48989 [doi]
LID - e48989
AB  - The communication gap between patients and health care professionals has led to 
      increased disputes and resource waste in the medical domain. The development of 
      artificial intelligence and other technologies brings new possibilities to solve 
      this problem. This viewpoint paper proposes a new relationship between patients 
      and health care professionals-"shared decision-making"-allowing both sides to 
      obtain a deeper understanding of the disease and reach a consensus during 
      diagnosis and treatment. Then, this paper discusses the important impact of 
      ChatGPT-like solutions in treating rheumatoid arthritis using methotrexate from 
      clinical and patient perspectives. For clinical professionals, ChatGPT-like 
      solutions could provide support in disease diagnosis, treatment, and clinical 
      trials, but attention should be paid to privacy, confidentiality, and regulatory 
      norms. For patients, ChatGPT-like solutions allow easy access to massive amounts 
      of information; however, the information should be carefully managed to ensure 
      safe and effective care. To ensure the effective application of ChatGPT-like 
      solutions in improving the relationship between patients and health care 
      professionals, it is essential to establish a comprehensive database and provide 
      legal, ethical, and other support. Above all, ChatGPT-like solutions could 
      benefit patients and health care professionals if they ensure evidence-based 
      solutions and data protection and collaborate with regulatory authorities and 
      regulatory evolution.

AB  - Orthognathic surgery, a multidisciplinary treatment for dentofacial deformities, 
      presents complex preoperative preparations and follow-up procedures. This study 
      aims to evaluate the effectiveness of ChatGPT-4, an artificial intelligence-based 
      language model, as a supportive tool during patient consultations for 
      orthognathic surgery. Nine critical questions that candidates for orthognathic 
      surgery should ask during a consultation were identified and posed to ChatGPT-4. 
      The responses were subsequently assessed by experienced plastic surgeons and 
      collaborating orthodontists at a leading orthognathic surgery center. Evaluations 
      focused on the accuracy, clarity, and comprehensibility of the information 
      provided. ChatGPT-4 generated comprehensive, clear, and accurate responses, 
      offering critical technical information to guide patients through the 
      complexities of orthognathic surgery. However, it consistently underscored the 
      necessity of individualized responses and emphasized that specialized medical 
      consultation is crucial for treatment and follow-up plans. While ChatGPT-4 shows 
      promise as a reliable informational resource, it cannot fully replace the nuanced 
      physician-patient relationship, particularly in situations requiring emotional 
      intelligence and specialized expertise. ChatGPT-4 can serve as an informative and 
      guiding assistant during the consultation process for orthognathic surgery, 
      although it cannot substitute for direct medical consultation. This tool could be 
      an asset for both patients and physicians in managing the intricate treatment 
      process of orthognathic surgery.

TI  - Will ChatGPT pass the Polish specialty exam in radiology and diagnostic imaging? 
      Insights into strengths and limitations.
PG  - e430-e434
LID - 10.5114/pjr.2023.131215 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Rapid development of artificial intelligence has aroused curiosity 
      regarding its potential applications in medical field. The purpose of this 
      article was to present the performance of ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art language 
      model in relation to pass rate of national specialty examination (PES) in 
      radiology and imaging diagnostics within Polish education system. Additionally, 
      the study aimed to identify the strengths and limitations of the model through a 
      detailed analysis of issues raised by exam questions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The 
      present study utilized a PES exam consisting of 120 questions, provided by 
      Medical Exami-nations Center in Lodz. Questions were administered using 
      openai.com platform that grants free access to GPT-3.5 model. All questions were 
      categorized according to Bloom's taxonomy to assess their complexity and 
      difficulty. Following the answer to each exam question, ChatGPT was asked to rate 
      its confidence on a scale of 1 to 5 to evaluate the accuracy of its response. 
      RESULTS: ChatGPT did not reach the pass rate threshold of PES exam (52%); 
      however, it was close in certain question categories. No significant differences 
      were observed in the percentage of correct answers across question types and 
      sub-types. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of the ChatGPT model in the pass rate of 
      PES exam in radiology and imaging diagnostics in Poland is yet to be determined, 
      which requires further research on improved versions of ChatGPT.

TI  - Evaluation of the Artificial Intelligence Chatbot on Breast Reconstruction and 
      Its Efficacy in Surgical Research: A Case Study.
PG  - 2360-2369
LID - 10.1007/s00266-023-03443-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: ChatGPT is an open-source artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot that 
      uses deep learning to produce human-like text dialog. Its potential applications 
      in the scientific community are vast; however, its efficacy on performing 
      comprehensive literature searches, data analysis and report writing in aesthetic 
      plastic surgery topics remains unknown. This study aims to evaluate both the 
      accuracy and comprehensiveness of ChatGPT's responses to assess its suitability 
      for use in aesthetic plastic surgery research. METHODS: Six questions were 
      prompted to ChatGPT on post-mastectomy breast reconstruction. First two questions 
      focused on the current evidence and options for breast reconstruction 
      post-mastectomy, and remaining four questions focused specifically on autologous 
      breast reconstruction. Using the Likert framework, the responses provided by 
      ChatGPT were qualitatively assessed for accuracy and information content by two 
      specialist plastic surgeons with extensive experience in the field. RESULTS: 
      ChatGPT provided relevant, accurate information; however, it lacked depth. It 
      could provide no more than a superficial overview in response to more esoteric 
      questions and generated incorrect references. It created non-existent references, 
      cited wrong journal and date, which poses a significant challenge in maintaining 
      academic integrity and caution of its use in academia. CONCLUSION: While ChatGPT 
      demonstrated proficiency in summarizing existing knowledge, it created fictitious 
      references which poses a significant concern of its use in academia and 
      healthcare. Caution should be exercised in interpreting its responses in the 
      aesthetic plastic surgical field and should only be used for such with sufficient 
      oversight. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE IV: This journal requires that authors assign a 
      level of evidence to each article. For a full description of these Evidence-Based 
      Medicine ratings, please refer to the Table of Contents or the online

TI  - Appropriateness of premature ovarian insufficiency recommendations provided by 
      ChatGPT.
PG  - 1033-1037
LID - 10.1097/GME.0000000000002246 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the appropriateness of ChatGPT's 
      responses to frequently asked queries regarding the prevention and treatment of 
      premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). METHODS: A set of 25 questions covering 
      topics related to disease risk factors, screening, symptoms, treatment, and 
      treatment adverse effects were posed to ChatGPT, and the responses were evaluated 
      by two experienced obstetrician/gynecologists. RESULTS: Of the responses given by 
      ChatGPT, 19 of 25 (76%) were deemed appropriate, five (20%) were rated as 
      inappropriate, and the remaining one (4%) was considered unreliable. There was no 
      question that ChatGPT answered completely incorrectly; answers that were 
      considered inappropriate included partially correct information. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      study's findings suggest that ChatGPT provides patients with mostly accurate 
      information about the POI but might present significantly inaccurate information. 
      However, it is important to note that further research is needed to validate the 
      use of artificial intelligence chatbots in the context of reproductive health, 
      especially for individuals who may be highly impacted by the emotional and 
      psychological effects of POI. In addition, given the complexity and individuality 
      of medical care, AI chatbots should not be considered a replacement for medical 
      professionals but rather a supplementary tool that can help patients access 
      reliable information and support. Overall, this study contributes to the growing 
      body of research on AI chatbots and their potential use in reproductive health, 
      highlighting both the benefits and limitations of these technologies.

TI  - Comparing Meta-Analyses with ChatGPT in the Evaluation of the Effectiveness and 
      Tolerance of Systemic Therapies in Moderate-to-Severe Plaque Psoriasis.
LID - 10.3390/jcm12165410 [doi]
LID - 5410
AB  - BACKGROUND: Meta-analyses (MAs) and network meta-analyses (NMAs) are high-quality 
      studies for assessing drug efficacy, but they are time-consuming and may be 
      affected by biases. The capacity of artificial intelligence to aggregate huge 
      amounts of information is emerging as particularly interesting for processing the 
      volume of information needed to generate MAs. In this study, we analyzed whether 
      the chatbot ChatGPT is able to summarize information in a useful fashion for 
      providers and patients in a way that matches up with the results of MAs/NMAs. 
      METHODS: We included 16 studies (13 NMAs and 3 MAs) that evaluate biologics (n = 
      6) and both biologic and systemic treatment (n = 10) for moderate-to-severe 
      psoriasis, published between January 2021 and May 2023. RESULTS: The conclusions 
      of the MAs/NMAs were compared to ChatGPT's answers to queries about the molecules 
      evaluated in the selected MAs/NMAs. The reproducibility between the results of 
      ChatGPT and the MAs/NMAs was random regarding drug safety. Regarding efficacy, 
      ChatGPT reached the same conclusion as 5 out of the 16 studies (four out of four 
      studies when three molecules were compared), gave acceptable answers in 7 out of 
      16 studies, and was inconclusive in 4 out of 16 studies. CONCLUSIONS: ChatGPT can 
      generate conclusions that are similar to MAs when the efficacy of fewer drugs is 
      compared but is still unable to summarize information in a way that matches up to 
      the results of MAs/NMAs when more than three molecules are compared.

TI  - Long-Term Survival of Patients With Glioblastoma of the Pineal Gland: A 
      ChatGPT-Assisted, Updated Case of a Multimodal Treatment Strategy Resulting in 
      Extremely Long Overall Survival at a Site With Historically Poor Outcomes.
PG  - e36590
LID - 10.7759/cureus.36590 [doi]
LID - e36590
AB  - We present an updated case report of a patient with glioblastoma isolated to the 
      pineal gland with an overall survival greater than five years and no progression 
      of focal central nervous system (CNS) deficits since initial presentation. The 
      patient underwent radiotherapy up to 60 Gy with concurrent and adjuvant 
      temozolomide with the use of non-standard treatment volumes that included the 
      ventricular system. The utilization of ventricular irradiation as well as the 
      addition of bevacizumab at disease recurrence may have encouraged this unusually 
      long survival by preventing/delaying leptomeningeal spread. We also present an 
      updated review of the literature, which shows a median survival of six months, 
      reinforcing the patients atypical disease trajectory. Finally, we utilize 
      OpenAI's language model ChatGPT to aid in synthesizing this manuscript. In doing 
      so, we demonstrate that ChatGPT is apt at creating concise summaries of relevant 
      literature and topic subjects, however its output is often repetitive with 
      similar sentence/paragraph structure, less than ideal grammar and poor syntax 
      requiring editing. Thus, in its current iteration, ChatGPT is a helpful aid that 
      cuts down on the time spent in data acquisition and processing but is not a 
      replacement for human input in the creation of quality medical literature.

      Performance Evaluation.
PG  - e48433
LID - 10.2196/48433 [doi]
LID - e48433
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since OpenAI released ChatGPT, with its strong capability in handling 
      natural tasks and its user-friendly interface, it has garnered significant 
      attention. OBJECTIVE: A prospective analysis is required to evaluate the accuracy 
      and appropriateness of medication consultation responses generated by ChatGPT. 
      METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted by the pharmacy 
      department of a medical center in Taiwan. The test data set comprised 
      retrospective medication consultation questions collected from February 1, 2023, 
      to February 28, 2023, along with common questions about drug-herb interactions. 
      Two distinct sets of questions were tested: real-world medication consultation 
      questions and common questions about interactions between traditional Chinese and 
      Western medicines. We used the conventional double-review mechanism. The 
      appropriateness of each response from ChatGPT was assessed by 2 experienced 
      pharmacists. In the event of a discrepancy between the assessments, a third 
      pharmacist stepped in to make the final decision. RESULTS: Of 293 real-world 
      medication consultation questions, a random selection of 80 was used to evaluate 
      ChatGPT's performance. ChatGPT exhibited a higher appropriateness rate in 
      responding to public medication consultation questions compared to those asked by 
      health care providers in a hospital setting (31/51, 61% vs 20/51, 39%; P=.01). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study suggest that ChatGPT could potentially 
      be used for answering basic medication consultation questions. Our analysis of 
      the erroneous information allowed us to identify potential medical risks 
      associated with certain questions; this problem deserves our close attention.

TI  - Comprehensive analysis of responses from ChatGPT to consumer inquiries regarding 
      over-the-counter medications.
PG  - 24-28
LID - 10.1691/ph.2024.3628 [doi]
AB  - Background: The use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications such 
      as ChatGPT is becoming increasingly popular. In Japan, consumers can purchase 
      most over-the-counter (OTC) drugs without having to consult a pharmacist, so they 
      may ask generative AI applications which OTC drugs they should purchase. This 
      study aimed to systematically evaluate responses from ChatGPT to consumer 
      inquiries about various OTC drugs. Methods: We selected 22 popular OTC drugs and 
      12 typical consumer characteristics, including physical and disease conditions 
      and concomitant medications. We input a total of 264 questions (i. e., all 
      combinations of drugs and characteristics) to ChatGPT in Japanese, asking whether 
      it is safe for consumers with each characteristic to take these OTC drugs. We 
      used the generic name for 10 of the 22 drugs and the brand name for the remaining 
      12. Responses were evaluated based on the following three criteria: 1) coherence 
      between the question and response, 2) scientific correctness, and 3) 
      appropriateness of the instructed actions. When we received a response that 
      satisfied all three criteria, we input the exact same question on a different day 
      to assess reproducibility. Results: The proportions of ChatGPT's answers that 
      satisfied criteria 1, 2, and 3 were 79.5%, 54.5%, and 49.6%, respectively. 
      However, the proportion of responses that satisfied all three criteria was only 
      20.8% (55/264); 61.8% (34/55) of these responses were reproduced when the same 
      question was input again on a different day. Compared with questions using 
      generic names, those using brand names resulted in lower coherence and scientific 
      correctness. Among the 12 characteristics, the appropriateness of the instructed 
      actions tended to be lower in responses to questions about driving and 
      concomitant medications. Conclusions: Our study revealed that ChatGPT was less 
      accurate in its responses and less consistent in its instructed actions compared 
      with the package inserts. Our findings suggest that Japanese consumers should not 
      consult ChatGPT regarding OTC medications, especially when using brand names.

TI  - Performance and risks of ChatGPT used in drug information: an exploratory 
      real-world analysis.
LID - ejhpharm-2023-003750 [pii]
LID - 10.1136/ejhpharm-2023-003750 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the performance and risk associated with the usage of 
      Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) to answer drug-related 
      questions. METHODS: A sample of 50 drug-related questions were consecutively 
      collected and entered in the artificial intelligence software application 
      ChatGPT. Answers were documented and rated in a standardised consensus process by 
      six senior hospital pharmacists in the domains content (correct, incomplete, 
      false), patient management (possible, insufficient, not possible) and risk (no 
      risk, low risk, high risk). As reference, answers were researched in adherence to 
      the German guideline of drug information and stratified in four categories 
      according to the sources used. In addition, the reproducibility of ChatGPT's 
      answers was analysed by entering three questions at different timepoints 
      repeatedly (day 1, day 2, week 2, week 3). RESULTS: Overall, only 13 of 50 
      answers provided correct content and had enough information to initiate 
      management with no risk of patient harm. The majority of answers were either 
      false (38%, n=19) or had partly correct content (36%, n=18) and no references 
      were provided. A high risk of patient harm was likely in 26% (n=13) of the cases 
      and risk was judged low for 28% (n=14) of the cases. In all high-risk cases, 
      actions could have been initiated based on the provided information. The answers 
      of ChatGPT varied over time when entered repeatedly and only three out of 12 
      answers were identical, showing no reproducibility to low reproducibility. 
      CONCLUSION: In a real-world sample of 50 drug-related questions, ChatGPT answered 
      the majority of questions wrong or partly wrong. The use of artificial 
      intelligence applications in drug information is not possible as long as barriers 
      like wrong content, missing references and reproducibility remain.

TI  - The Emerging Role of AI in Patient Education: A Comparative Analysis of LLM 
      Accuracy for Pelvic Organ Prolapse.
LID - 10.1159/000538538 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy, completeness, precision, 
      and readability of outputs generated by three Large Language Models (LLMs): GPT 
      by OpenAI, BARD by Google, and Bing by Microsoft, in comparison to patient 
      education material on Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) provided by the Royal College 
      of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (RCOG). METHODS: A total of 15 questions were 
      retrieved from the RCOG website and input into the three LLMs. Two independent 
      reviewers evaluated the outputs for accuracy, completeness, and precision. 
      Readability was assessed using the Simplified Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) 
      score and the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL) score. RESULTS: Significant 
      differences were observed in completeness and precision metrics. ChatGPT ranked 
      highest in completeness (66.7%), while Bing led in precision (100%). No 
      significant differences were observed in accuracy across all models. In terms of 
      readability, ChatGPT exhibited higher difficulty than BARD, Bing, and the 
      original RCOG answers. CONCLUSION: While all models displayed a variable degree 
      of correctness, ChatGPT excelled in completeness, significantly surpassing BARD 
      and Bing. However, Bing led in precision, providing the most relevant and concise 
      answers. Regarding readability, ChatGPT exhibited higher difficulty. The study 
      found that while all LLMs showed varying degrees of correctness in answering RCOG 
      questions on patient information for Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP), ChatGPT was the 
      most comprehensive, but its answers were harder to read. Bing, on the other hand, 
      was the most precise. The findings highlight the potential of LLMs in health 
      information dissemination and the need for careful interpretation of their 
      outputs.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently become a trending tool and topic 
      regarding productivity especially with publicly available free services such as 
      ChatGPT and Bard. In this report, we investigate if two widely available chatbots 
      chatGPT and Bard, are able to show consistent accurate responses for the best 
      imaging modality for urologic clinical situations and if they are in line with 
      American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria (AC). All clinical 
      scenarios provided by the ACR were inputted into ChatGPT and Bard with result 
      compared to the ACR AC and recorded. Both chatbots had an appropriate imaging 
      modality rate of of 62% and no significant difference in proportion of correct 
      imaging modality was found overall between the two services (p&gt;0.05). The results 
      of our study found that both ChatGPT and Bard are similar in their ability to 
      suggest the most appropriate imaging modality in a variety of urologic scenarios 
      based on ACR AC criteria. Nonetheless, both chatbots lack consistent accuracy and 
      further development is necessary for implementation in clinical settings. For 
      proper use of these AI services in clinical decision making, further developments 
      are needed to improve the workflow of physicians.

TI  - AI-Generated Information for Vascular Patients: Assessing the Standard of 
      Procedure-Specific Information Provided by the ChatGPT AI-Language Model.
PG  - e49764
LID - 10.7759/cureus.49764 [doi]
LID - e49764
AB  - Introduction Ensuring access to high-quality information is paramount to 
      facilitating informed surgical decision-making. The use of the internet to access 
      health-related information is increasing, along with the growing prevalence of AI 
      language models such as ChatGPT. We aim to assess the standard of AI-generated 
      patient-facing information through a qualitative analysis of its readability and 
      quality. Materials and methods We performed a retrospective qualitative analysis 
      of information regarding three common vascular procedures: endovascular aortic 
      repair (EVAR), endovenous laser ablation (EVLA), and femoro-popliteal bypass 
      (FPBP). The ChatGPT responses were compared to patient information leaflets 
      provided by the vascular charity, Circulation Foundation UK. Readability was 
      assessed using four readability scores: the Flesch-Kincaid reading ease (FKRE) 
      score, the Flesch-Kincaid grade level (FKGL), the Gunning fog score (GFS), and 
      the simple measure of gobbledygook (SMOG) index. Quality was assessed using the 
      DISCERN tool by two independent assessors. Results The mean FKRE score was 33.3, 
      compared to 59.1 for the information provided by the Circulation Foundation 
      (SD=14.5, p=0.025) indicating poor readability of AI-generated information. The 
      FFKGL indicated that the expected grade of students likely to read and understand 
      ChatGPT responses was consistently higher than compared to information leaflets 
      at 12.7 vs. 9.4 (SD=1.9, p=0.002). Two metrics measure readability in terms of 
      the number of years of education required to understand a piece of writing: the 
      GFS and SMOG. Both scores indicated that AI-generated answers were less 
      accessible. The GFS for ChatGPT-provided information was 16.7 years versus 12.8 
      years for the leaflets (SD=2.2, p=0.002) and the SMOG index scores were 12.2 and 
      9.4 years for ChatGPT and the patient information leaflets, respectively (SD=1.7, 
      p=0.001). The DISCERN scores were consistently higher in human-generated patient 
      information leaflets compared to AI-generated information across all procedures; 
      the mean score for the information provided by ChatGPT was 50.3 vs. 56.0 for the 
      Circulation Foundation information leaflets (SD=3.38, p&lt;0.001). Conclusion We 
      concluded that AI-generated information about vascular surgical procedures is 
      currently poor in both the readability of text and the quality of information. 
      Patients should be directed to reputable, human-generated information sources 
      from trusted professional bodies to supplement direct education from the 
      clinician during the pre-procedure consultation process.

TI  - ChatGPT: Forensic, legal, and ethical issues.
PG  - 150-156
LID - 10.1177/00258024231191829 [doi]
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to a group of technologies that enable people 
      to perform a variety of activities, including observing, comprehending, analysing 
      and translating data, among other things. Nowadays, practically every school of 
      thought is interested in AI. One such innovation, a chatbot by the name of 
      ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer), launched by OpenAI recently, 
      has taken the internet by storm. It had one million users within 1 week of its 
      launch. The present communication explores the practicability and versatility of 
      the ChatGPT in forensic examinations and scenarios, and also addresses the 
      ethical and legal issues surrounding its usage. The observations suggest that the 
      said technology, in its current form, has limited relevance in the realm of 
      forensic science and the law. Only human critical thinking, expertise, and 
      practical experience can provide the information and competencies needed in the 
      realms of forensics, research, clinical and legal practices. Thus, the ChatGPT 
      should be used with utmost caution in the disciplines of medicine, forensic 
      science and the law, irrespective of its many positive attributes.

AB  - Large-language models like ChatGPT have recently received a great deal of 
      attention. To assess ChatGPT in the field of genetics, we compared its 
      performance to human respondents in answering genetics questions (involving 
      13,636 responses) that had been posted on social media platforms starting in 
      2021. Overall, ChatGPT did not perform significantly differently than human 
      respondents, but did significantly better on memorization-type questions versus 
      critical thinking questions, frequently provided different answers when asked 
      questions multiple times, and provided plausible explanations for both correct 
      and incorrect answers.

AB  - MÃ¡jovskÃ½ and colleagues have investigated the important issue of ChatGPT being 
      used for the complete generation of scientific works, including fake data and 
      tables. The issues behind why ChatGPT poses a significant concern to research 
      reach far beyond the model itself. Once again, the lack of reproducibility and 
      visibility of scientific works creates an environment where fraudulent or 
      inaccurate work can thrive. What are some of the ways in which we can handle this 
      new situation?

TI  - ChatGPT: Chances and Challenges for Dentistry.
PG  - 220-224
AB  - The artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot ChatGPT has generated both huge interest 
      and deep concern since its launch in November 2022.1 ChatGPT, a large language 
      model (LLM) with a conversational interface, has been trained on vast amounts of 
      human-generated text and has the ability to respond to questions and complete 
      various text-related tasks. The use of ChatGPT and similar LLMs in dentistry is 
      unlikely to significantly impact the daily routine of most dental healthcare 
      personnel but could streamline administrative workflows and potentially serve as 
      an additional tool for clinical decision support in the future. However, this is 
      contingent on the availability of comprehensive, up-to-date, and unbiased data. 
      The use of LLMs also causes privacy and cybersecurity concerns. It is therefore 
      crucial to implement robust data protection measures and strong defenses against 
      malicious use of LLMs. Although ChatGPT provides succinct answers to most 
      queries, its lack of reliability, transparency, and up-to-date knowledge compared 
      with conventional search engines is a major drawback, particularly for 
      health-related queries.

      Aversion and Appreciation.
PG  - 3837-3844
LID - 10.2147/PRBM.S430936 [doi]
AB  - In recent times, ChatGPT has garnered significant interest from the public, 
      sparking a range of reactions that encompass both aversion and appreciation. This 
      paper delves into the paradoxical attitudes of individuals towards ChatGPT, 
      highlighting the simultaneous existence of algorithmic aversion and appreciation. 
      A comprehensive analysis is conducted from the vantage points of psychology and 
      algorithmic decision-making, exploring the underlying causes of these conflicting 
      attitudes from three dimensions: self-performance, task types, and individual 
      factors. Subsequently, strategies to reconcile these opposing psychological 
      stances are proposed, delineated into two categories: flexible coping and 
      inflexible coping. In light of the ongoing advancements in artificial 
      intelligence, this paper posits recommendations for the attitudes and actions 
      that individuals ought to adopt in the face of artificial intelligence. 
      Regardless of whether one exhibits algorithm aversion or appreciation, the paper 
      underscores that coexisting with algorithms is an inescapable reality in the age 
      of artificial intelligence, necessitating the preservation of human advantages.

AB  - In November 2022, OpenAI publicly launched its large language model (LLM), 
      ChatGPT, and reached the milestone of having over 100 million users in only 2 
      months. LLMs have been shown to be useful in a myriad of health care-related 
      tasks and processes. In this paper, I argue that attention to, public access to, 
      and debate about LLMs have initiated a wave of products and services using 
      generative artificial intelligence (AI), which had previously found it hard to 
      attract physicians. This paper describes what AI tools have become available 
      since the beginning of the ChatGPT revolution and contemplates how it they might 
      change physicians' perceptions about this breakthrough technology.

LID - 10.1016/j.arth.2024.03.017 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A consumer-focused health care model not only allows unprecedented 
      access to information, but equally warrants consideration of the appropriateness 
      of providing accurate patient health information. Nurses play a large role in 
      influencing patient satisfaction following total knee arthroplasty (TKA), but 
      they come at a cost. A specific natural language artificial intelligence (AI) 
      model, ChatGPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer), has accumulated over 100 
      million users within months of launching. As such, we aimed to compare: 1) 
      orthopaedic surgeons' evaluation of the appropriateness of the answers to the 
      most frequently asked patient questions after TKA; and 2) patients' comfort level 
      in answering their postoperative questions by using answers provided by 
      arthroplasty-trained nurses and ChatGPT. METHODS: We prospectively created 60 
      questions based on the most commonly asked patient questions following TKA. There 
      were three fellowship-trained surgeons who assessed the answers provided by 
      arthroplasty-trained nurses and ChatGPT-4 to each of the questions. The surgeons 
      graded each set of responses based on clinical judgment as: 1) "appropriate," 2) 
      "inappropriate" if the response contained inappropriate information, or 3) 
      "unreliable," if the responses provided inconsistent content. Patients' comfort 
      level and trust in AI were assessed using research electronic data capture 
      (REDCap) hosted at our local hospital. RESULTS: The surgeons graded 44 out of 60 
      (73.3%) responses for the arthroplasty-trained nurses and 44 out of 60 (73.3%) 
      for ChatGPT to be "appropriate." There were four responses graded "inappropriate" 
      and one response graded "unreliable" provided by the nurses. For the ChatGPT 
      response, there were five responses graded "inappropriate" and no responses 
      graded "unreliable." There were 136 patients (53.8%) who were more comfortable 
      with the answers provided by ChatGPT compared to 86 patients (34.0%) who 
      preferred the answers from arthroplasty-trained nurses. Of the 253 patients, 233 
      (92.1%) were uncertain if they would trust AI to answer their postoperative 
      questions. There were 127 patients (50.2%) who answered that if they knew the 
      previous answer was provided by ChatGPT, their comfort level in trusting the 
      answer would change. CONCLUSION: One potential use of ChatGPT can be found in 
      providing appropriate answers to patient questions after TKA. At our institution, 
      cost expenditures can potentially be minimized while maintaining patient 
      satisfaction. Inevitably, successful implementation is dependent on the ability 
      to provide information that is credible and in accordance with the objectives of 
      both physicians and patients.

TI  - Exploring the use of ChatGPT in predicting anterior circulation stroke functional 
      outcomes after mechanical thrombectomy: a pilot study.

LID - 10.1136/jnis-2024-021556 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate prediction of functional outcomes is crucial in stroke 
      management, but this remains challenging. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance 
      of the generative language model ChatGPT in predicting the functional outcome of 
      patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) 3âmonths after mechanical thrombectomy 
      (MT) in order to assess whether ChatGPT can used to be accurately predict the 
      modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 3 months post-thrombectomy. METHODS: We 
      conducted a retrospective analysis of clinical, neuroimaging, and 
      procedure-related data from 163 patients with AIS undergoing MT. The agreement 
      between ChatGPT's exact and dichotomized predictions and actual mRS scores was 
      assessed using Cohen's Îº. The added value of ChatGPT was measured by evaluating 
      the agreement of predicted dichotomized outcomes using an existing validated 
      score, the MT-DRAGON. RESULTS: ChatGPT demonstrated fair (Îº=0.354, 95%âCI 0.260 
      to 0.448) and good (Îº=0.727, 95%âCI 0.620 to 0.833) agreement with the true exact 
      and dichotomized mRS scores at 3 months, respectively, outperforming MT-DRAGON in 
      overall and subgroup predictions. ChatGPT agreement was higher for patients with 
      shorter last-time-seen-well-to-door delay, distal occlusions, and better modified 
      Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction scores. CONCLUSIONS: ChatGPT adequately 
      predicted short-term functional outcomes in post-thrombectomy patients with AIS 
      and was better than the existing risk score. Integrating AI models into clinical 
      practice holds promise for patient care, yet refining these models is crucial for 
      enhanced accuracy in stroke management.

TI  - ChatGPT identifies gender disparities in scientific peer review.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.90230 [doi]
LID - RP90230
AB  - The peer review process is a critical step in ensuring the quality of scientific 
      research. However, its subjectivity has raised concerns. To investigate this 
      issue, I examined over 500 publicly available peer review reports from 200 
      published neuroscience papers in 2022-2023. OpenAI's generative artificial 
      intelligence ChatGPT was used to analyze language use in these reports, which 
      demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional lexicon- and rule-based 
      language models. As expected, most reviews for these published papers were seen 
      as favorable by ChatGPT (89.8% of reviews), and language use was mostly polite 
      (99.8% of reviews). However, this analysis also demonstrated high levels of 
      variability in how each reviewer scored the same paper, indicating the presence 
      of subjectivity in the peer review process. The results further revealed that 
      female first authors received less polite reviews than their male peers, 
      indicating a gender bias in reviewing. In addition, published papers with a 
      female senior author received more favorable reviews than papers with a male 
      senior author, for which I discuss potential causes. Together, this study 
      highlights the potential of generative artificial intelligence in performing 
      natural language processing of specialized scientific texts. As a proof of 
      concept, I show that ChatGPT can identify areas of concern in scientific peer 
      review, underscoring the importance of transparent peer review in studying 
      equitability in scientific publishing.

OAB - Peer review is a vital step in ensuring the quality and accuracy of scientific 
      research before publication. Experts assess research manuscripts, advise journal 
      editors on publishing them, and provide authors with recommendations for 
      improvement. But some scientists have raised concerns about potential biases and 
      subjectivity in the peer review process. Author attributes, such as gender, 
      reputation, or how prestigious their institution is, may subconsciously influence 
      reviewersâ scores. Studying peer review to identify potential biases is 
      challenging. The language reviewers use is very technical, and some of their 
      commentary may be subjective and vary from reviewer to reviewer. The emergence of 
      OpenAIâs ChatGPT, which uses machine learning to process large amounts of 
      information, may provide a new tool to analyze peer review for signs of bias. 
      Verharen demonstrated that ChatGPT can be used to analyze peer review reports and 
      found potential indications of gender bias in scientific publishing. In the 
      experiments, Verharen asked ChatGPT to analyze more than 500 reviews of 200 
      neuroscience studies published in the scientific journal Nature Communications 
      over the past year. The experiments found no evidence that institutional 
      reputation influenced reviews. Yet, female first authors were more likely to 
      receive impolite comments from reviewers. Female senior authors were more likely 
      to receive higher review scores, which may indicate they had to clear a higher 
      bar for publication. The experiments indicate that ChatGPT could be used to 
      analyze peer review for fairness. Verharen suggests that reviewers might apply 
      this tool to ensure their reviews are polite and accurate reflections of their 
      opinions. Scientists or publishers might also use it for large-scale analyses of 
      peer review in individual journals or in scientific publishing more widely. 
      Journals might also use ChatGPT to assess the impact of bias-prevention 
      interventions on review fairness.

TI  - Exploring the Unknown: Evaluating ChatGPT's Performance in Uncovering Novel 
      Aspects of Plastic Surgery and Identifying Areas for Future Innovation.
LID - 10.1007/s00266-024-03952-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool in 
      various medical fields, including plastic surgery. This study aims to evaluate 
      the performance of ChatGPT, an AI language model, in elucidating historical 
      aspects of plastic surgery and identifying potential avenues for innovation. 
      METHODS: A comprehensive analysis of ChatGPT's responses to a diverse range of 
      plastic surgery-related inquiries was performed. The quality of the AI-generated 
      responses was assessed based on their relevance, accuracy, and novelty. 
      Additionally, the study examined the AI's ability to recognize gaps in existing 
      knowledge and propose innovative solutions. ChatGPT's responses were analysed by 
      specialist plastic surgeons with extensive research experience, and 
      quantitatively analysed with a Likert scale. RESULTS: ChatGPT demonstrated a high 
      degree of proficiency in addressing a wide array of plastic surgery-related 
      topics. The AI-generated responses were found to be relevant and accurate in most 
      cases. However, it demonstrated convergent thinking and failed to generate 
      genuinely novel ideas to revolutionize plastic surgery. Instead, it suggested 
      currently popular trends that demonstrate great potential for further 
      advancements. Some of the references presented were also erroneous as they cannot 
      be validated against the existing literature. CONCLUSION: Although ChatGPT 
      requires major improvements, this study highlights its potential as an effective 
      tool for uncovering novel aspects of plastic surgery and identifying areas for 
      future innovation. By leveraging the capabilities of AI language models, plastic 
      surgeons may drive advancements in the field. Further studies are needed to 
      cautiously explore the integration of AI-driven insights into clinical practice 
      and to evaluate their impact on patient outcomes. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE V: This

TI  - Artificial Intelligence Chatbots' Understanding of the Risks and Benefits of 
      Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scenarios.
PG  - 8465371231220561
LID - 10.1177/08465371231220561 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Patients may seek online information to better understand medical 
      imaging procedures. The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of 
      information provided by 2 popular artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots 
      pertaining to common imaging scenarios' risks, benefits, and alternatives. 
      METHODS: Fourteen imaging-related scenarios pertaining to computed tomography 
      (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used. Factors including the use of 
      intravenous contrast, the presence of renal disease, and whether the patient was 
      pregnant were included in the analysis. For each scenario, 3 prompts for 
      outlining the (1) risks, (2) benefits, and (3) alternative imaging choices or 
      potential implications of not using contrast were inputted into ChatGPT and Bard. 
      A grading rubric and a 5-point Likert scale was used by 2 independent reviewers 
      to grade responses. Prompt variability and chatbot context dependency were also 
      assessed. RESULTS: ChatGPT's performance was superior to Bard's in accurately 
      responding to prompts per Likert grading (4.36âÂ±â0.63 vs 3.25âÂ±â1.03 seconds, 
      Pâ&lt;â.0001). There was substantial agreement between independent reviewer grading 
      for ChatGPT (Îºâ=â0.621) and Bard (Îºâ=â0.684). Response text length was not 
      statistically different between ChatGPT and Bard (2087âÂ±â256 characters vs 
      2162âÂ±â369 characters, Pâ=â.24). Response time was longer for ChatGPT (34âÂ±â2 vs 
      8âÂ±â1âseconds, Pâ&lt;â.0001). CONCLUSIONS: ChatGPT performed superior to Bard at 
      outlining risks, benefits, and alternatives to common imaging scenarios. 
      Generally, context dependency and prompt variability did not change chatbot 
      response content. Due to the lack of detailed scientific reasoning and inability 
      to provide patient-specific information, both AI chatbots have limitations as a 
      patient information resource.

      Analysis for Patients and Healthcare Professionals.
PG  - e46736
LID - 10.7759/cureus.46736 [doi]
LID - e46736
AB  - AIM: We aimed to evaluate the performance of Chat Generative Pre-trained 
      Transformer (ChatGPT) within the context of inflammatory bowel disease&nbsp;(IBD), 
      which is expected to become an increasingly significant health issue in the 
      future. In addition, the objective of the study was to assess whether ChatGPT 
      serves as a reliable and useful resource for both patients and healthcare 
      professionals. METHODS: For this study, 20 specific questions were identified for 
      the two main components of IBD, which are Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative 
      colitis (UC). The questions were divided into two sets: one set contained 
      questions directed at healthcare professionals while the second set contained 
      questions directed toward&nbsp;patients. The responses were evaluated with seven-point 
      Likert-type reliability and usefulness scales. RESULTS: The distribution of the 
      reliability and utility scores was calculated into four groups (two diseases and 
      two question sources) by averaging the mean scores from both raters.&nbsp;The highest 
      scores in both reliability and usefulness were obtained from professional sources 
      (5.00Â± 1.21 and 5.15Â±1.08, respectively). The ranking in terms of reliability and 
      usefulness, respectively, was as follows: CD questions&nbsp;(4.70Â±1.26 and 4.75Â±1.06) 
      and UC questions (4.40Â±1.21 and 4.55Â±1.31). The reliability scores of the answers 
      for the professionals were significantly higher than those for the patients (both 
      raters, p=0.032).&nbsp; Conclusion: Despite its capacity for reliability and 
      usefulness in the context of IBD, ChatGPT still has some limitations and 
      deficiencies.&nbsp;The correction of ChatGPT's deficiencies and its enhancement by 
      developers with more detailed and up-to-date information could make it a 
      significant source of information for both patients and medical professionals.

TI  - Applications of the Natural Language Processing Tool ChatGPT in Clinical 
      Practice: Comparative Study and Augmented Systematic Review.
PG  - e48933
LID - 10.2196/48933 [doi]
LID - e48933
AB  - BACKGROUND: This research integrates a comparative analysis of the performance of 
      human researchers and OpenAI's ChatGPT in systematic review tasks and describes 
      an assessment of the application of natural language processing (NLP) models in 
      clinical practice through a review of 5 studies. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to 
      evaluate the reliability between ChatGPT and human researchers in extracting key 
      information from clinical articles, and to investigate the practical use of NLP 
      in clinical settings as evidenced by selected studies. METHODS: The study design 
      comprised a systematic review of clinical articles executed independently by 
      human researchers and ChatGPT. The level of agreement between and within raters 
      for parameter extraction was assessed using the Fleiss and Cohen Îº statistics. 
      RESULTS: The comparative analysis revealed a high degree of concordance between 
      ChatGPT and human researchers for most parameters, with less agreement for study 
      design, clinical task, and clinical implementation. The review identified 5 
      significant studies that demonstrated the diverse applications of NLP in clinical 
      settings. These studies' findings highlight the potential of NLP to improve 
      clinical efficiency and patient outcomes in various contexts, from enhancing 
      allergy detection and classification to improving quality metrics in 
      psychotherapy treatments for veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the potential of NLP models, including 
      ChatGPT, in performing systematic reviews and other clinical tasks. Despite 
      certain limitations, NLP models present a promising avenue for enhancing health 
      care efficiency and accuracy. Future studies must focus on broadening the range 
      of clinical applications and exploring the ethical considerations of implementing 
      NLP applications in health care settings.

TI  - Ethical Considerations of Using ChatGPT in Health Care.
PG  - e48009
LID - 10.2196/48009 [doi]
LID - e48009
AB  - ChatGPT has promising applications in health care, but potential ethical issues 
      need to be addressed proactively to prevent harm. ChatGPT presents potential 
      ethical challenges from legal, humanistic, algorithmic, and informational 
      perspectives. Legal ethics concerns arise from the unclear allocation of 
      responsibility when patient harm occurs and from potential breaches of patient 
      privacy due to data collection. Clear rules and legal boundaries are needed to 
      properly allocate liability and protect users. Humanistic ethics concerns arise 
      from the potential disruption of the physician-patient relationship, humanistic 
      care, and issues of integrity. Overreliance on artificial intelligence (AI) can 
      undermine compassion and erode trust. Transparency and disclosure of AI-generated 
      content are critical to maintaining integrity. Algorithmic ethics raise concerns 
      about algorithmic bias, responsibility, transparency and explainability, as well 
      as validation and evaluation. Information ethics include data bias, validity, and 
      effectiveness. Biased training data can lead to biased output, and overreliance 
      on ChatGPT can reduce patient adherence and encourage self-diagnosis. Ensuring 
      the accuracy, reliability, and validity of ChatGPT-generated content requires 
      rigorous validation and ongoing updates based on clinical practice. To navigate 
      the evolving ethical landscape of AI, AI in health care must adhere to the 
      strictest ethical standards. Through comprehensive ethical guidelines, health 
      care professionals can ensure the responsible use of ChatGPT, promote accurate 
      and reliable information exchange, protect patient privacy, and empower patients 
      to make informed decisions about their health care.

AB  - Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) necessitate specialized renal diets to 
      prevent complications such as hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia. A comprehensive 
      assessment of food components is pivotal, yet burdensome for healthcare 
      providers. With evolving artificial intelligence (AI) technology, models such as 
      ChatGPT, Bard AI, and Bing Chat can be instrumental in educating patients and 
      assisting professionals. To gauge the efficacy of different AI models in 
      discerning potassium and phosphorus content in foods, four AI models-ChatGPT 3.5, 
      ChatGPT 4, Bard AI, and Bing Chat-were evaluated. A total of 240 food items, 
      curated from the Mayo Clinic Renal Diet Handbook for CKD patients, were input 
      into each model. These items were characterized by their potassium (149 items) 
      and phosphorus (91 items) content. Each model was tasked to categorize the items 
      into high or low potassium and high phosphorus content. The results were 
      juxtaposed with the Mayo Clinic Renal Diet Handbook's recommendations. The 
      concordance between repeated sessions was also evaluated to assess model 
      consistency. Among the models tested, ChatGPT 4 displayed superior performance in 
      identifying potassium content, correctly classifying 81% of the foods. It 
      accurately discerned 60% of low potassium and 99% of high potassium foods. In 
      comparison, ChatGPT 3.5 exhibited a 66% accuracy rate. Bard AI and Bing Chat 
      models had an accuracy rate of 79% and 81%, respectively. Regarding phosphorus 
      content, Bard AI stood out with a flawless 100% accuracy rate. ChatGPT 3.5 and 
      Bing Chat recognized 85% and 89% of the high phosphorus foods correctly, while 
      ChatGPT 4 registered a 77% accuracy rate. Emerging AI models manifest a diverse 
      range of accuracy in discerning potassium and phosphorus content in foods 
      suitable for CKD patients. ChatGPT 4, in particular, showed a marked improvement 
      over its predecessor, especially in detecting potassium content. The Bard AI 
      model exhibited exceptional precision for phosphorus identification. This study 
      underscores the potential of AI models as efficient tools in renal dietary 
      planning, though refinements are warranted for optimal utility.

TI  - Evaluating the Efficacy of AI Chatbots as Tutors in Urology: A Comparative 
      Analysis of Responses to the 2022 In-Service Assessment of the European Board of 
      Urology.
LID - 10.1159/000537854 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study assessed the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) 
      as educational tools by evaluating their accuracy in answering questions across 
      urological subtopics. METHODS: Three LLMs (ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, and Bing AI) 
      were examined in two testing rounds, separated by 48-hours, using 100 
      Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) from the 2022 European Board of Urology (EBU) 
      In-Service Assessment (ISA), covering five different subtopics. The correct 
      answer was defined as "formal accuracy" (FA) representing the designated single 
      best answer (SBA) among four options. Alternative answers selected from LLMs, 
      which may not necessarily be the SBA but are still deemed correct, were labeled 
      as "extended accuracy" (EA). Their capacity to enhance the overall accuracy rate 
      when combined with FA was examined. RESULTS: In two rounds of testing, the FAs 
      scores were achieved as follows: ChatGPT-3.5: 58% and 62%, ChatGPT-4: 63% and 
      77%, and BING AI: 81% and 73%. The incorporation of EA did not yield a 
      significant enhancement in overall performance. The achieved gains for 
      ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, and BING AI were as a result 7% and 5%, 5% and 2%, and 3% 
      and 1%, respectively (p&gt;0.3). Within urological subtopics, LLMs showcased best 
      performance in Pediatrics/Congenital and comparatively less effectiveness in 
      Functional/BPS/Incontinence. CONCLUSION: LLMs exhibit suboptimal urology 
      knowledge and unsatisfactory proficiency for educational purposes. The overall 
      accuracy did not significantly improve when combining EA to FA. The error rates 
      remained high ranging from 16 to 35%. Proficiency levels vary substantially 
      across subtopics. Further development of medicine specific LLMs is required 
      before integration into urological training programs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Taiwan is well-known for its quality healthcare system. The country's 
      medical licensing exams offer a way to evaluate ChatGPT's medical proficiency. 
      METHODS: We analyzed exam data from February 2022, July 2022, February 2023, and 
      July 2033. Each exam included four papers with 80 single-choice questions, 
      grouped as descriptive or picture-based. We used ChatGPT-4 for evaluation. 
      Incorrect answers prompted a "chain of thought" approach. Accuracy rates were 
      calculated as percentages. RESULTS: ChatGPT-4's accuracy in medical exams ranged 
      from 63.75% to 93.75% (February 2022-July 2023). The highest accuracy (93.75%) 
      was in February 2022's Medicine Exam (3). Subjects with the highest misanswered 
      rates were ophthalmology (28.95%), breast surgery (27.27%), plastic surgery 
      (26.67%), orthopedics (25.00%), and general surgery (24.59%). While using "chain 
      of thought," the "Accuracy of (CoT) prompting" ranged from 0.00% to 88.89%, and 
      the final overall accuracy rate ranged from 90% to 98%. CONCLUSION: ChatGPT-4 
      succeeded in Taiwan's medical licensing exams. With the "chain of thought" 
      prompt, it improved accuracy to over 90%.

TI  - The role of an artificial intelligence model in antiretroviral therapy 
      counselling and advice for people living with HIV.
LID - 10.1111/hiv.13604 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: People living with HIV may find personalized access to accurate 
      information on antiretroviral therapy (ART) challenging given the stigma and 
      costs potentially associated with attending physical consultations. Artificial 
      intelligence (AI) chatbots such as ChatGPT may help to lower barriers to 
      accessing information addressing concerns around ART initiation. However, the 
      safety and accuracy of the information provided remains to be studied. METHODS: 
      We instructed ChatGPT to answer questions that people living with HIV frequently 
      ask about ART, covering i) knowledge of and access to ART; ii) ART initiation, 
      side effects, and adherence, and iii) general sexual health practices while 
      receiving ART. We checked the accuracy of the advice against international HIV 
      clinical practice guidelines. RESULTS: ChatGPT answered all questions accurately 
      and comprehensively. It recognized potentially life-threatening scenarios such as 
      abacavir hypersensitivity reaction and gave appropriate advice. However, in 
      certain contexts, such as specific geographic locations or for pregnant 
      individuals, the advice lacked specificity to an individual's unique 
      circumstances and may be inadequate. Nevertheless, ChatGPT consistently 
      re-directed the individual to seek help from a healthcare professional to obtain 
      targeted advice. CONCLUSIONS: ChatGPT may act as a useful adjunct in the process 
      of ART counselling for people living with HIV. Improving access to information on 
      and knowledge about ART may improve access and adherence to ART and outcomes for 
      people living with HIV overall.

LID - e1912
AB  - BACKGROUND: ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI) language model that has 
      gained popularity as a virtual assistant because of its exceptional capacity to 
      solve problems and make decisions. However, there are some ways in which 
      technological misuse and incorrect interpretations can have potentially hazardous 
      consequences for a user's mental health. DISCUSSION: Because it lacks real-time 
      fact-checking capabilities, ChatGPT may create misleading or erroneous 
      information. Considering AI technology has the potential to influence a person's 
      thinking, we anticipate ChatGPT's future repercussions on mental health by 
      considering instances in which inappropriate usage may lead to mental disorders. 
      While several studies have demonstrated how the AI model may transform mental 
      health care and therapy, certain drawbacks, including bias and privacy 
      violations, have also been identified. CONCLUSION: Educating people and 
      organizing workshops on AI technology usage, strengthening privacy measures, and 
      updating ethical standards are crucial initiatives to prevent misuse and 
      resultant dire impacts on mental health. Longitudinal research on the potential 
      of these platforms to impact a variety of mental health problems is recommended 
      in the future.

TI  - Can ChatGPT Help in Electronics Research and Development? A Case Study with 
      Applied Sensors.
LID - 10.3390/s23104879 [doi]
LID - 4879
AB  - In this paper, we investigated the applicability of ChatGPT AI in electronics 
      research and development via a case study of applied sensors in embedded 
      electronic systems, a topic that is rarely mentioned in the recent literature, 
      thus providing new insight for professionals and academics. The initial 
      electronics-development tasks of a smart home project were prompted to the 
      ChatGPT system to find out its capabilities and limitations. We wanted to obtain 
      detailed information on the central processing controller units and the actual 
      sensors usable for the specific project, their specifications and recommendations 
      on the hardware and software design flow additionally. Furthermore, an extensive 
      literature survey was requested to see if the bot could offer scientific papers 
      covering the given topic. It was found that the ChatGPT responded with proper 
      recommendations on controllers. However, the suggested sensor units, the hardware 
      and software design were only partially acceptable, with occasional errors in 
      specifications and generated code. The results of the literature survey showed 
      that non-acceptable, fabricated citations (fake authors list, title, journal 
      details and DOI-Digital Object identifier) were presented by the bot. The paper 
      provides a detailed qualitative analysis, a performance analysis and critical 
      discussion of the aforementioned aspects while providing the query set, the 
      generated answers and codes as supplied data with the goal to give added value to 
      electronics researchers and developers if trying to reach out for the tools in 
      their profession.

TI  - Assessing the Competence of Artificial Intelligence Programs in Pediatric 
      Ophthalmology and Strabismus and Comparing their Relative Advantages.
PG  - 389-393
LID - 10.22336/rjo.2023.61 [doi]
AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to determine the knowledge levels of ChatGPT, 
      Bing, and Bard artificial intelligence programs produced by three different 
      manufacturers regarding pediatric ophthalmology and strabismus and to compare 
      their strengths and weaknesses. Methods: Forty-four questions testing the 
      knowledge levels of pediatric ophthalmology and strabismus were asked in ChatGPT, 
      Bing, and Bard artificial intelligence programs. Questions were grouped as 
      correct or incorrect. The accuracy rates were statistically compared. Results: 
      ChatGPT chatbot gave 59.1% correct answers, Bing chatbot gave 70.5% correct 
      answers, and Bard chatbot gave 72.7% correct answers to the questions asked. No 
      significant difference was observed between the rates of correct answers to the 
      questions in all 3 artificial intelligence programs (p=0.343, Pearson's 
      chi-square test). Conclusion: Although information about pediatric ophthalmology 
      and strabismus can be accessed using current artificial intelligence programs, 
      the answers given may not always be accurate. Care should always be taken when 
      evaluating this information.

TI  - The Significance of Artificial Intelligence Platforms in Anatomy Education: An 
      Experience With ChatGPT and Google Bard.
PG  - e45301
LID - 10.7759/cureus.45301 [doi]
LID - e45301
AB  - This study evaluated the use of two large language models (LLMs), ChatGPT and 
      Google Bard, in anatomy education. The models were asked to answer questions, 
      generate multiple-choice questions, and write articles on anatomy topics. The 
      results showed that the models were able to perform these tasks with varying 
      degrees of accuracy. ChatGPT and Google Bard did not differ significantly in 
      terms of answering questions. Both models were able to generate multiple-choice 
      questions with a high degree of accuracy. However, the performance of the models 
      in article writing was not yet at a sufficient level. The study also found that 
      the use of LLMs in medical education requires caution. This is because LLMs are 
      still under development and they can sometimes generate inaccurate or misleading 
      information. It is important to carefully evaluate the output of LLMs before 
      using them in educational settings. Overall, the study found that LLMs have the 
      potential to be valuable tools for anatomy education. However, more research is 
      needed to improve the accuracy of the models and to better understand how they 
      can be used effectively in educational settings.

TI  - Screening/diagnosis of pediatric endocrine disorders through the artificial 
      intelligence model in different language settings.
LID - 10.1007/s00431-024-05527-1 [doi]
AB  - This study is aimed at examining the impact of ChatGPT on pediatric endocrine and 
      metabolic conditions, particularly in the areas of screening and diagnosis, in 
      both Chinese and English modes. A 40-question questionnaire covering the four 
      most common pediatric endocrine and metabolic conditions was posed to ChatGPT in 
      both Chinese and English three times each. Six pediatric endocrinologists 
      evaluated the responses. ChatGPT performed better when responding to questions in 
      English, with an unreliable rate of 7.5% compared to 27.5% for Chinese questions, 
      indicating a more consistent response pattern in English. Among the reliable 
      questions, the answers were more comprehensive and satisfactory in the English 
      mode. We also found disparities in ChatGPT's performance when interacting with 
      different target groups and diseases, with improved performance for questions 
      posed by clinicians in English and better performance for questions related to 
      diabetes and overweight/obesity in Chinese for both clinicians and patients. 
      Language comprehension, providing incomprehensive answers, and errors in key data 
      were the main contributors to the low scores, according to reviewer feedback. 
      CONCLUSION: Despite these limitations, as ChatGPT continues to evolve and expand 
      its network, it has significant potential as a practical and effective tool for 
      clinical diagnosis and treatment. WHAT IS KNOWN: â¢ The deep learning-based 
      large-language model ChatGPT holds great promise for improving clinical practice 
      for both physicians and patients and has the potential to increase the speed and 
      accuracy of disease screening and diagnosis, as well as enhance the overall 
      efficiency of the medical process. However, the reliability and appropriateness 
      of AI model responses in specific field remains unclear. â¢ This study focused on 
      the reliability and appropriateness of AI model responses to straightforward and 
      fundamental questions related to the four most prevalent pediatric endocrine and 
      metabolic disorders, for both healthcare providers and patients, in different 
      language scenarios. WHAT IS NEW: â¢ The AI model performed better when responding 
      to questions in English, with more consistent, as well as more comprehensive and 
      satisfactory responses. In addition, we also found disparities in ChatGPT's 
      performance when interacting with different target groups and different diseases. 
      â¢ Despite these limitations, as ChatGPT continues to evolve and expand its 
      network, it has significant potential as a practical and effective tool for 
      clinical diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - Learning about oneâs implicit bias is crucial for improving oneâs cultural 
      competency and thereby reducing health inequity. To evaluate bias among medical 
      students following a previously developed cultural training program targeting New 
      Zealand MÄori, we developed a text-based, self-evaluation tool called the 
      Similarity Rating Test (SRT). The development process of the SRT was 
      resource-intensive, limiting its generalizability and applicability. Here, we 
      explored the potential of ChatGPT, an automated chatbot, to assist in the 
      development process of the SRT by comparing ChatGPTâs and studentsâ evaluations 
      of the SRT. Despite results showing non-significant equivalence and difference 
      between ChatGPTâs and studentsâ ratings, ChatGPTâs ratings were more consistent 
      than studentsâ ratings. The consistency rate was higher for non-stereotypical 
      than for stereotypical statements, regardless of rater type. Further studies are 
      warranted to validate ChatGPTâs potential for assisting in SRT development for 
      implementation in medical education and evaluation of ethnic stereotypes and 
      related topics.

TI  - ChatGPT's quiz skills in different otolaryngology subspecialties: an analysis of 
      2576 single-choice and multiple-choice board certification preparation questions.
PG  - 4271-4278
LID - 10.1007/s00405-023-08051-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: With the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in various 
      domains, including healthcare, there is growing acceptance and interest in 
      consulting AI models to provide medical information and advice. This study aimed 
      to evaluate the accuracy of ChatGPT's responses to practice quiz questions 
      designed for otolaryngology board certification and decipher potential 
      performance disparities across different otolaryngology subspecialties. METHODS: 
      A dataset covering 15 otolaryngology subspecialties was collected from an online 
      learning platform funded by the German Society of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology, Head and 
      Neck Surgery, designed for board certification examination preparation. These 
      questions were entered into ChatGPT, with its responses being analyzed for 
      accuracy and variance in performance. RESULTS: The dataset included 2576 
      questions (479 multiple-choice and 2097 single-choice), of which 57% (nâ=â1475) 
      were answered correctly by ChatGPT. An in-depth analysis of question style 
      revealed that single-choice questions were associated with a significantly higher 
      rate (pâ&lt;â0.001) of correct responses (nâ=â1313; 63%) compared to multiple-choice 
      questions (nâ=â162; 34%). Stratified by question categories, ChatGPT yielded the 
      highest rate of correct responses (nâ=â151; 72%) in the field of allergology, 
      whereas 7 out of 10 questions (nâ=â65; 71%) on legal otolaryngology aspects were 
      answered incorrectly. CONCLUSION: The study reveals ChatGPT's potential as a 
      supplementary tool for otolaryngology board certification preparation. However, 
      its propensity for errors in certain otolaryngology areas calls for further 
      refinement. Future research should address these limitations to improve ChatGPT's 
      educational use. An approach, with expert collaboration, is recommended for the 
      reliable and accurate integration of such AI models.

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the ability of generative artificial intelligence models 
      to answer ophthalmology board-style questions. DESIGN: Experimental study. 
      METHODS: This study evaluated 3 large language models (LLMs) with chat 
      interfaces, Bing Chat (Microsoft) and ChatGPT 3.5 and 4.0 (OpenAI), using 250 
      questions from the Basic Science and Clinical Science Self-Assessment Program. 
      Although ChatGPT is trained on information last updated in 2021, Bing Chat 
      incorporates a more recently indexed internet search to generate its answers. 
      Performance was compared with human respondents. Questions were categorized by 
      complexity and patient care phase, and instances of information fabrication or 
      nonlogical reasoning were documented. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was 
      response accuracy. Secondary outcomes were performance in question subcategories 
      and hallucination frequency. RESULTS: Human respondents had an average accuracy 
      of 72.2%. ChatGPT-3.5 scored the lowest (58.8%), whereas ChatGPT-4.0 (71.6%) and 
      Bing Chat (71.2%) performed comparably. ChatGPT-4.0 excelled in workup-type 
      questions (odds ratio [OR], 3.89, 95% CI, 1.19-14.73, P&nbsp;=&nbsp;.03) compared with 
      diagnostic questions, but struggled with image interpretation (OR, 0.14, 95% CI, 
      0.05-0.33, P &lt; .01) when compared with single-step reasoning questions. Against 
      single-step questions, Bing Chat also faced difficulties with image 
      interpretation (OR, 0.18, 95% CI, 0.08-0.44, P &lt; .01) and multi-step reasoning 
      (OR, 0.30, 95% CI, 0.11-0.84, P&nbsp;=&nbsp;.02). ChatGPT-3.5 had the highest rate of 
      hallucinations and nonlogical reasoning (42.4%), followed by ChatGPT-4.0 (18.0%) 
      and Bing Chat (25.6%). CONCLUSIONS: LLMs (particularly ChatGPT-4.0 and Bing Chat) 
      can perform similarly with human respondents answering questions from the Basic 
      Science and Clinical Science Self-Assessment Program. The frequency of 
      hallucinations and nonlogical reasoning suggests room for improvement in the 
      performance of conversational agents in the medical domain.

TI  - ChatGPT Output Regarding Compulsory Vaccination and COVID-19 Vaccine Conspiracy: 
      A Descriptive Study at the Outset of a Paradigm Shift in Online Search for 
      Information.
PG  - e35029
LID - 10.7759/cureus.35029 [doi]
LID - e35029
AB  - BACKGROUND: Being on the verge of a revolutionary approach to gathering 
      information, ChatGPT (an artificial intelligence (AI)-based language model 
      developed by OpenAI, and capable of producing human-like text) could be the prime 
      motive of a paradigm shift on how humans will acquire information. Despite the 
      concerns related to the use of such a promising tool in relation to the future of 
      the quality of education, this technology will soon be incorporated into web 
      search engines mandating the need to evaluate the output of such a tool. Previous 
      studies showed that dependence on some sources of online information (e.g., 
      social media platforms) was associated with higher rates of vaccination 
      hesitancy. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to describe the output of 
      ChatGPT regarding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine conspiracy beliefs. 
      and compulsory vaccination. METHODS: The current descriptive study was conducted 
      on January 14, 2023 using the ChatGPT from OpenAI (OpenAI, L.L.C.,&nbsp;San Francisco, 
      CA, USA). The output was evaluated by two authors and the degree of agreement 
      regarding the correctness, clarity, conciseness, and bias was evaluated using 
      Cohen's kappa. RESULTS: The ChatGPT responses were dismissive of conspiratorial 
      ideas about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) origins 
      labeling it as non-credible and lacking scientific evidence. Additionally, 
      ChatGPT responses were totally against COVID-19 vaccine conspiracy statements. 
      Regarding compulsory vaccination, ChatGPT responses were neutral citing the 
      following as advantages of this strategy: protecting public health, maintaining 
      herd immunity, reducing the spread of disease, cost-effectiveness, and legal 
      obligation, and on the other hand, it cited the following as disadvantages of 
      compulsory vaccination: ethical and legal concerns, mistrust and resistance, 
      logistical challenges, and limited resources and knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      current study showed that ChatGPT could be a source of information to challenge 
      COVID-19 vaccine conspiracies. For compulsory vaccination, ChatGPT resonated with 
      the divided opinion in the scientific community toward&nbsp;such a strategy; 
      nevertheless, it detailed the pros and cons of this approach. As it currently 
      stands, the judicious use of ChatGPT could be utilized as a user-friendly source 
      of COVID-19 vaccine information that could challenge conspiracy ideas with clear, 
      concise, and non-biased content. However, ChatGPT content cannot be used as an 
      alternative to the original reliable sources of vaccine information (e.g., the 
      World Health Organization [WHO] and the Centers for Disease Control and 
      Prevention [CDC]).

TI  - Chat GPT for the management of obstructive sleep apnea: do we have a polar star?
PG  - 2087-2093
LID - 10.1007/s00405-023-08270-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study explores the potential of the Chat-Generative Pre-Trained 
      Transformer (Chat-GPT), a Large Language Model (LLM), in assisting healthcare 
      professionals in the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). It aims to 
      assess the agreement between Chat-GPT's responses and those of expert 
      otolaryngologists, shedding light on the role of AI-generated content in medical 
      decision-making. METHODS: A prospective, cross-sectional study was conducted, 
      involving 350 otolaryngologists from 25 countries who responded to a specialized 
      OSA survey. Chat-GPT was tasked with providing answers to the same survey 
      questions. Responses were assessed by both super-experts and statistically 
      analyzed for agreement. RESULTS: The study revealed that Chat-GPT and expert 
      responses shared a common answer in over 75% of cases for individual questions. 
      However, the overall consensus was achieved in only four questions. Super-expert 
      assessments showed a moderate agreement level, with Chat-GPT scoring slightly 
      lower than experts. Statistically, Chat-GPT's responses differed significantly 
      from experts' opinions (pâ=â0.0009). Sub-analysis revealed areas of improvement 
      for Chat-GPT, particularly in questions where super-experts rated its responses 
      lower than expert consensus. CONCLUSIONS: Chat-GPT demonstrates potential as a 
      valuable resource for OSA diagnosis, especially where access to specialists is 
      limited. The study emphasizes the importance of AI-human collaboration, with 
      Chat-GPT serving as a complementary tool rather than a replacement for medical 
      professionals. This research contributes to the discourse in otolaryngology and 
      encourages further exploration of AI-driven healthcare applications. While 
      Chat-GPT exhibits a commendable level of consensus with expert responses, ongoing 
      refinements in AI-based healthcare tools hold significant promise for the future 
      of medicine, addressing the underdiagnosis and undertreatment of OSA and 
      improving patient outcomes.

TI  - Assessment of ChatGPT in the Prehospital Management of Ophthalmological 
      Emergencies - An Analysis of 10 Fictional Case Vignettes.
LID - 10.1055/a-2149-0447 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The artificial intelligence (AI)-based platform ChatGPT (Chat 
      Generative Pre-Trained Transformer, OpenAI LP, San Francisco, CA, USA) has gained 
      impressive popularity in recent months. Its performance on case vignettes of 
      general medical (non-ophthalmological) emergencies has been assessed - with very 
      encouraging results. The purpose of this study was to assess the performance of 
      ChatGPT on ophthalmological emergency case vignettes in terms of the main outcome 
      measures triage accuracy, appropriateness of recommended prehospital measures, 
      and overall potential to inflict harm to the user/patient. METHODS: We wrote ten 
      short, fictional case vignettes describing different acute ophthalmological 
      symptoms. Each vignette was entered into ChatGPT five times with the same wording 
      and following a standardized interaction pathway. The answers were analyzed 
      following a systematic approach. RESULTS: We observed a triage accuracy of 93.6%. 
      Most answers contained only appropriate recommendations for prehospital measures. 
      However, an overall potential to inflict harm to users/patients was present in 
      32% of answers. CONCLUSION: ChatGPT should presently not be used as a stand-alone 
      primary source of information about acute ophthalmological symptoms. As AI 
      continues to evolve, its safety and efficacy in the prehospital management of 
      ophthalmological emergencies has to be reassessed regularly.

TI  - Chat Generative Pretraining Transformer Answers Patient-focused Questions in 
      Cervical Spine Surgery.
LID - 10.1097/BSD.0000000000001600 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Review of Chat Generative Pretraining Transformer (ChatGPT) outputs 
      to select patient-focused questions. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the quality 
      of ChatGPT responses to cervical spine questions. BACKGROUND: Artificial 
      intelligence and its utilization to improve patient experience across medicine is 
      seeing remarkable growth. One such usage is patient education. For the first time 
      on a large scale, patients can ask targeted questions and receive similarly 
      targeted answers. Although patients may use these resources to assist in 
      decision-making, there still exists little data regarding their accuracy, 
      especially within orthopedic surgery and more specifically spine surgery. 
      METHODS: We compiled 9 frequently asked questions cervical spine surgeons receive 
      in the clinic to test ChatGPT's version 3.5 ability to answer a nuanced topic. 
      Responses were reviewed by 2 independent reviewers on a Likert Scale for the 
      accuracy of information presented (0-5 points), appropriateness in giving a 
      specific answer (0-3 points), and readability for a layperson (0-2 points). 
      Readability was assessed through the Flesh-Kincaid grade level analysis for the 
      original prompt and for a second prompt asking for rephrasing at the sixth-grade 
      reading level. RESULTS: On average, ChatGPT's responses scored a 7.1/10. Accuracy 
      was rated on average a 4.1/5. Appropriateness was 1.8/3. Readability was a 1.2/2. 
      Readability was determined to be at the 13.5 grade level originally and at the 
      11.2 grade level after prompting. CONCLUSIONS: ChatGPT has the capacity to be a 
      powerful means for patients to gain important and specific information regarding 
      their pathologies and surgical options. These responses are limited in their 
      accuracy, and we, in addition, noted readability is not optimal for the average 
      patient. Despite these limitations in ChatGPT's capability to answer these 
      nuanced questions, the technology is impressive, and surgeons should be aware 
      patients will likely increasingly rely on it.

LID - e48659
AB  - BACKGROUND: Large language model (LLM)-based artificial intelligence chatbots 
      direct the power of large training data sets toward successive, related tasks as 
      opposed to single-ask tasks, for which artificial intelligence already achieves 
      impressive performance. The capacity of LLMs to assist in the full scope of 
      iterative clinical reasoning via successive prompting, in effect acting as 
      artificial physicians, has not yet been evaluated. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to 
      evaluate ChatGPT's capacity for ongoing clinical decision support via its 
      performance on standardized clinical vignettes. METHODS: We inputted all 36 
      published clinical vignettes from the Merck Sharpe &amp; Dohme (MSD) Clinical Manual 
      into ChatGPT and compared its accuracy on differential diagnoses, diagnostic 
      testing, final diagnosis, and management based on patient age, gender, and case 
      acuity. Accuracy was measured by the proportion of correct responses to the 
      questions posed within the clinical vignettes tested, as calculated by human 
      scorers. We further conducted linear regression to assess the contributing 
      factors toward ChatGPT's performance on clinical tasks. RESULTS: ChatGPT achieved 
      an overall accuracy of 71.7% (95% CI 69.3%-74.1%) across all 36 clinical 
      vignettes. The LLM demonstrated the highest performance in making a final 
      diagnosis with an accuracy of 76.9% (95% CI 67.8%-86.1%) and the lowest 
      performance in generating an initial differential diagnosis with an accuracy of 
      60.3% (95% CI 54.2%-66.6%). Compared to answering questions about general medical 
      knowledge, ChatGPT demonstrated inferior performance on differential diagnosis 
      (Î²=-15.8%; P&lt;.001) and clinical management (Î²=-7.4%; P=.02) question types. 
      CONCLUSIONS: ChatGPT achieves impressive accuracy in clinical decision-making, 
      with increasing strength as it gains more clinical information at its disposal. 
      In particular, ChatGPT demonstrates the greatest accuracy in tasks of final 
      diagnosis as compared to initial diagnosis. Limitations include possible model 
      hallucinations and the unclear composition of ChatGPT's training data set.

      and bard.
PG  - e27026
LID - 10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e27026 [doi]
LID - e27026
AB  - This study presents a comprehensive analysis comparing the literacy levels of two 
      Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) tools, ChatGPT and Bard, using a dataset 
      of 134 questions from the Human Resources (HR) domain. The generated responses 
      are evaluated for accuracy, relevance, and clarity. We find that ChatGPT 
      outperforms Bard in overall accuracy (84.3% vs. 82.8%). This difference in 
      performance suggests that ChatGPT could serve as a robotic advisor in 
      transactional HR roles. In contrast, Bard may possess additional safeguards 
      against misuse in the HR function, making it less capable of generating responses 
      to certain types of questions. Statistical tests reveal that although the two 
      systems differ in their mean accuracy, relevance, and clarity of the responses, 
      the observed differences are not always statistically significant, implying that 
      both tools may be more complementary than competitive. The Pearson correlation 
      coefficients further support this by showing weak to non-existent relationships 
      in performance metrics between the two tools. Confirmation queries don't improve 
      ChatGPT or Bard's response accuracy. The study thus contributes to emerging 
      research on the utility of GAI tools in Human Resources Management and suggests 
      that involving certified HR professionals in the design phase could enhance 
      underlying language model performance.

LID - 10.1097/NNE.0000000000001566 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The research on ChatGPT-generated nursing care planning texts is 
      critical for enhancing nursing education through innovative and accessible 
      learning methods, improving reliability and quality. PURPOSE: The aim of the 
      study was to examine the quality, authenticity, and reliability of the nursing 
      care planning texts produced using ChatGPT. METHODS: The study sample comprised 
      40 texts generated by ChatGPT selected nursing diagnoses that were included in 
      NANDA 2021-2023. The texts were evaluated by using a descriptive criteria form 
      and the DISCERN tool to evaluate health information. RESULTS: DISCERN total 
      average score of the texts was 45.93 Â± 4.72. All texts had a moderate level of 
      reliability and 97.5% of them provided moderate quality subscale score of 
      information. A statistically significant relationship was found among the number 
      of accessible references, reliability (r = 0.408), and quality subscale score (r 
      = 0.379) of the texts (P &lt; .05). CONCLUSION: ChatGPT-generated texts exhibited 
      moderate reliability, quality of nursing care information, and overall quality 
      despite low similarity rates.

AB  - This study explores the potential of OpenAI's ChatGPT as a decision support tool 
      for acute ulcerative colitis presentations in the setting of an emergency 
      department. We assessed ChatGPT's performance in determining disease severity 
      using TrueLove and Witts criteria and the necessity of hospitalization for 
      patients with ulcerative colitis, comparing results with those of expert 
      gastroenterologists. Of 20 cases, ChatGPT's assessments were found to be 80% 
      consistent with gastroenterologist evaluations and indicated a high degree of 
      reliability. This suggests that ChatGPT could provide as a clinical decision 
      support tool in assessing acute ulcerative colitis, serving as an adjunct to 
      clinical judgment.

TI  - ChatGPT Responses to Common Questions About Anterior Cruciate Ligament 
      Reconstruction Are Frequently Satisfactory.
LID - S0749-8063(23)01013-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.arthro.2023.12.009 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate ChatGPT responses to common questions patients have 
      regarding anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. METHODS: Ten 
      frequently asked questions regarding ACL tears and ACL reconstruction were chosen 
      from the frequently asked questions found on the websites of major institutions. 
      These were presented to ChatGPT and responses were rated as "excellent response 
      not requiring clarification," "satisfactory requiring minimal clarification," 
      "satisfactory requiring moderate clarification," or "unsatisfactory requiring 
      substantial clarification." RESULTS: Four responses were satisfactory, requiring 
      minimal clarification, 3 were satisfactory, requiring moderate clarification, 2 
      were unsatisfactory, and 1 was excellent, requiring no clarification. 
      CONCLUSIONS: As hypothesized, ChatGPT provided generally accurate information to 
      common questions around ACL reconstruction. Although clarification often was 
      needed, responses were satisfactory for providing generalized information about 
      ACL tears and ACL reconstruction. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: ChatGPT is a promising 
      avenue for patients to learn about general background information regarding ACL 
      reconstruction, although questions specific to any planned operation need to be 
      addressed directly with an orthopaedic provider.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if ChatGPT can generate useful suggestions for improving 
      clinical decision support (CDS) logic and to assess noninferiority compared to 
      human-generated suggestions. METHODS: We supplied summaries of CDS logic to 
      ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence (AI) tool for question answering that uses a 
      large language model, and asked it to generate suggestions. We asked human 
      clinician reviewers to review the AI-generated suggestions as well as 
      human-generated suggestions for improving the same CDS alerts, and rate the 
      suggestions for their usefulness, acceptance, relevance, understanding, workflow, 
      bias, inversion, and redundancy. RESULTS: Five clinicians analyzed 36 
      AI-generated suggestions and 29 human-generated suggestions for 7 alerts. Of the 
      20 suggestions that scored highest in the survey, 9 were generated by ChatGPT. 
      The suggestions generated by AI were found to offer unique perspectives and were 
      evaluated as highly understandable and relevant, with moderate usefulness, low 
      acceptance, bias, inversion, redundancy. CONCLUSION: AI-generated suggestions 
      could be an important complementary part of optimizing CDS alerts, can identify 
      potential improvements to alert logic and support their implementation, and may 
      even be able to assist experts in formulating their own suggestions for CDS 
      improvement. ChatGPT shows great potential for using large language models and 
      reinforcement learning from human feedback to improve CDS alert logic and 
      potentially other medical areas involving complex, clinical logic, a key step in 
      the development of an advanced learning health system.

AB  - Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are advanced artificial intelligence 
      models that are designed to process and understand human language. LLMs have the 
      potential to improve radiology reporting and patient engagement by automating 
      generation of the clinical history and impression of a radiology report, creating 
      layperson reports, and providing patients with pertinent questions and answers 
      about findings in radiology reports. However, LLMs are error prone, and human 
      oversight is needed to reduce the risk of patient harm.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the feasibility and performance of Chat Generative 
      Pretrained Transformer (ChatGPT) in converting symptom narratives into structured 
      symptom labels. METHODS: We extracted symptoms from 300 deidentified symptom 
      narratives of COVID-19 patients by a computer-based matching algorithm (the 
      standard), and prompt engineering in ChatGPT. Common symptoms were those with a 
      prevalence &gt;10% according to the standard, and similarly less common symptoms 
      were those with a prevalence of 2-10%. The precision of ChatGPT was compared with 
      the standard using sensitivity and specificity with 95% exact binomial CIs (95% 
      binCIs). In ChatGPT, we prompted without examples (zero-shot prompting) and with 
      examples (few-shot prompting). RESULTS: In zero-shot prompting, GPT-4 achieved 
      high specificity (0.947 [95% binCI: 0.894-0.978]-1.000 [95% binCI: 0.965-0.988, 
      1.000]) for all symptoms, high sensitivity for common symptoms (0.853 [95% binCI: 
      0.689-0.950]-1.000 [95% binCI: 0.951-1.000]), and moderate sensitivity for less 
      common symptoms (0.200 [95% binCI: 0.043-0.481]-1.000 [95% binCI: 0.590-0.815, 
      1.000]). Few-shot prompting increased the sensitivity and specificity. GPT-4 
      outperformed GPT-3.5 in response accuracy and consistent labelling. DISCUSSION: 
      This work substantiates ChatGPT's role as a research tool in medical fields. Its 
      performance in converting symptom narratives to structured symptom labels was 
      encouraging, saving time and effort in compiling the task-specific training data. 
      It potentially accelerates free-text data compilation and synthesis in future 
      disease outbreaks and improves the accuracy of symptom checkers. Focused prompt 
      training addressing ambiguous descriptions impacts medical research positively.

TI  - Interdisciplinary Inquiry via PanelGPT: Application to Explore Chatbot 
      Application in Sports Rehabilitation.
LID - 2023.07.23.23292452 [pii]
LID - 10.1101/2023.07.23.23292452 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: ChatGPT showcases exceptional conversational capabilities and 
      extensive cross-disciplinary knowledge. In addition, it possesses the ability to 
      perform multiple roles within a single chat session. This unique 
      multi-role-playing feature positions ChatGPT as a promising tool to explore 
      interdisciplinary subjects. OBJECTIVE: The study intended to guide ChatGPT for 
      interdisciplinary exploration through simulated panel discussions. As a 
      proof-of-concept, we employed this method to evaluate the advantages and 
      challenges of using chatbots in sports rehabilitation. METHODS: We proposed a 
      model termed PanelGPT to explore ChatGPTs' knowledge graph on interdisciplinary 
      topics through simulated panel discussions. Applied to "chatbots in sports 
      rehabilitation", ChatGPT role-played both the moderator and panelists, which 
      included a physiotherapist, psychologist, nutritionist, AI expert, and an 
      athlete. We act as the audience posed questions to the panel, with ChatGPT acting 
      as both the panelists for responses and the moderator for hosting the discussion. 
      We performed the simulation using the ChatGPT-4 model and evaluated the responses 
      with existing literature and human expertise. RESULTS: Each simulation mimicked a 
      real-life panel discussion: The moderator introduced the panel and posed 
      opening/closing questions, to which all panelists responded. The experts engaged 
      with each other to address inquiries from the audience, primarily from their 
      respective fields of expertise. By tackling questions related to education, 
      physiotherapy, physiology, nutrition, and ethical consideration, the discussion 
      highlighted benefits such as 24/7 support, personalized advice, automated 
      tracking, and reminders. It also emphasized the importance of user education and 
      identified challenges such as limited interaction modes, inaccuracies in 
      emotion-related advice, assurance on data privacy and security, transparency in 
      data handling, and fairness in model training. The panelists reached a consensus 
      that chatbots are designed to assist, not replace, human healthcare professionals 
      in the rehabilitation process. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to a typical conversation 
      with ChatGPT, the multi-perspective approach of PanelGPT facilitates a 
      comprehensive understanding of an interdisciplinary topic by integrating insights 
      from experts with complementary knowledge. Beyond addressing the exemplified 
      topic of chatbots in sports rehabilitation, the model can be adapted to tackle a 
      wide array of interdisciplinary topics within educational, research, and 
      healthcare settings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Natural language processing is a form of artificial intelligence that 
      allows human users to interface with a machine without using complex codes. The 
      ability of natural language processing systems, such as ChatGPT, to successfully 
      engage with healthcare systems requiring fluid reasoning, specialist data 
      interpretation, and empathetic communication in an unfamiliar and evolving 
      environment is poorly studied. This study investigated whether the ChatGPT 
      interface could engage with and complete a mock objective structured clinical 
      examination simulating assessment for membership of the Royal College of 
      Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine 
      whether ChatGPT, without additional training, would achieve a score at least 
      equivalent to that achieved by human candidates who sat for virtual objective 
      structured clinical examinations in Singapore. STUDY DESIGN: This study was 
      conducted in 2 phases. In the first phase, a total of 7 structured discussion 
      questions were selected from 2 historical cohorts (cohorts A and B) of objective 
      structured clinical examination questions. ChatGPT was examined using these 
      questions and responses recorded in a script. Of note, 2 human candidates (acting 
      as anonymizers) were examined on the same questions using videoconferencing, and 
      their responses were transcribed verbatim into written scripts. The 3 sets of 
      response scripts were mixed, and each set was allocated to 1 of 3 human actors. 
      In the second phase, actors were used to presenting these scripts to examiners in 
      response to the same examination questions. These responses were blind scored by 
      14 qualified examiners. ChatGPT scores were unblinded and compared with 
      historical human candidate performance scores. RESULTS: The average score given 
      to ChatGPT by 14 examiners was 77.2%. The average historical human score (n=26 
      candidates) was 73.7 %. ChatGPT demonstrated sizable performance improvements 
      over the average human candidate in several subject domains. The median time 
      taken for ChatGPT to complete each station was 2.54 minutes, well before the 10 
      minutes allowed. CONCLUSION: ChatGPT generated factually accurate and 
      contextually relevant structured discussion answers to complex and evolving 
      clinical questions based on unfamiliar settings within a very short period. 
      ChatGPT outperformed human candidates in several knowledge areas. Not all 
      examiners were able to discern between human and ChatGPT responses. Our data 
      highlight the emergent ability of natural language processing models to 
      demonstrate fluid reasoning in unfamiliar environments and successfully compete 
      with human candidates that have undergone extensive specialist training.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: The workload of clinical documentation contributes to health 
      care costs and professional burnout. The advent of generative artificial 
      intelligence language models presents a promising solution. The perspective of 
      clinicians may contribute to effective and responsible implementation of such 
      tools. This study sought to evaluate 3 uses for generative artificial 
      intelligence for clinical documentation in pediatric emergency medicine, 
      measuring time savings, effort reduction, and physician attitudes and identifying 
      potential risks and barriers. METHODS: This mixed-methods study was performed 
      with 10 pediatric emergency medicine attending physicians from a single pediatric 
      emergency department. Participants were asked to write a supervisory note for 4 
      clinical scenarios, with varying levels of complexity, twice without any 
      assistance and twice with the assistance of ChatGPT Version 4.0. Participants 
      evaluated 2 additional ChatGPT-generated clinical summaries: a structured handoff 
      and a visit summary for a family written at an 8th grade reading level. Finally, 
      a semistructured interview was performed to assess physicians' perspective on the 
      use of ChatGPT in pediatric emergency medicine. Main outcomes and measures 
      included between subjects' comparisons of the effort and time taken to complete 
      the supervisory note with and without ChatGPT assistance. Effort was measured 
      using a self-reported Likert scale of 0 to 10. Physicians' scoring of and 
      attitude toward the ChatGPT-generated summaries were measured using a 0 to 10 
      Likert scale and open-ended questions. Summaries were scored for completeness, 
      accuracy, efficiency, readability, and overall satisfaction. A thematic analysis 
      was performed to analyze the content of the open-ended questions and to identify 
      key themes. RESULTS: ChatGPT yielded a 40% reduction in time and a 33% decrease 
      in effort for supervisory notes in intricate cases, with no discernible effect on 
      simpler notes. ChatGPT-generated summaries for structured handoffs and family 
      letters were highly rated, ranging from 7.0 to 9.0 out of 10, and most 
      participants favored their inclusion in clinical practice. However, there were 
      several critical reservations, out of which a set of general recommendations for 
      applying ChatGPT to clinical summaries was formulated. CONCLUSION: Pediatric 
      emergency medicine attendings in our study perceived that ChatGPT can deliver 
      high-quality summaries while saving time and effort in many scenarios, but not 
      all.

TI  - Opportunities and challenges for ChatGPT and large language models in biomedicine 
      and health.
LID - 10.1093/bib/bbad493 [doi]

AB  - ChatGPT has drawn considerable attention from both the general public and domain 
      experts with its remarkable text generation capabilities. This has subsequently 
      led to the emergence of diverse applications in the field of biomedicine and 
      health. In this work, we examine the diverse applications of large language 
      models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, in biomedicine and health. Specifically, we 
      explore the areas of biomedical information retrieval, question answering, 
      medical text summarization, information extraction and medical education and 
      investigate whether LLMs possess the transformative power to revolutionize these 
      tasks or whether the distinct complexities of biomedical domain presents unique 
      challenges. Following an extensive literature survey, we find that significant 
      advances have been made in the field of text generation tasks, surpassing the 
      previous state-of-the-art methods. For other applications, the advances have been 
      modest. Overall, LLMs have not yet revolutionized biomedicine, but recent rapid 
      progress indicates that such methods hold great potential to provide valuable 
      means for accelerating discovery and improving health. We also find that the use 
      of LLMs, like ChatGPT, in the fields of biomedicine and health entails various 
      risks and challenges, including fabricated information in its generated 
      responses, as well as legal and privacy concerns associated with sensitive 
      patient data. We believe this survey can provide a comprehensive and timely 
      overview to biomedical researchers and healthcare practitioners on the 
      opportunities and challenges associated with using ChatGPT and other LLMs for 
      transforming biomedicine and health.

AB  - ChatGPT - currently the most popular generative artificial intelligence system - 
      has been revolutionizing the world and healthcare since its release in November 
      2022. ChatGPT is a conversational chatbot that uses machine learning algorithms 
      to enhance its replies based on user interactions and is a part of a broader 
      effort to develop natural language processing that can assist people in their 
      daily lives by understanding and responding to human language in a useful and 
      engaging way. Thus far, many potential applications within healthcare have been 
      described, despite its relatively recent release. This manuscript offers the 
      pediatric surgical community a primer on this new technology and discusses some 
      initial observations about its potential uses and pitfalls. Moreover, it 
      introduces the perspectives of medical journals and surgical societies regarding 
      the use of this artificial intelligence chatbot. As ChatGPT and other large 
      language models continue to evolve, it is the responsibility of the pediatric 
      surgery community to stay abreast of these changes and play an active role in 
      safely incorporating them into our field for the benefit of our patients. LEVEL

TI  - ChatGPT: Is This Patient Education Tool for Urological Malignancies Readable for 
      the General Population?
PG  - 31-37
LID - 10.2147/RRU.S440633 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With widespread adoption of technological advancements in everyday 
      life, patients are now increasingly able and willing to obtain information about 
      their health conditions, treatment options, and indeed expected outcomes via the 
      convenience of any device than can access the worldwide web. This introduces 
      another aspect of patient care in the provision of healthcare for the modern 
      doctor. ChatGPT is the first of an increasing number of self learning programs 
      that have been released recently which may revolutionize and impact healthcare 
      delivery. METHODS: The aim of this study is to obtain an objective measure of the 
      readability of information provided on ChatGPT when compared with current 
      validated patient information sheets provided by government health institutions 
      in Western Australia. The same structured questions were input into the program 
      for three major urological malignancies (urothelial, renal, and prostate), with 
      the response generated evaluated with a validated readability scoring system - 
      Flesch-Kincaid reading ease score. The same scoring system was then applied to 
      current patient information sheets in circulation from Cancer Council Australia 
      and UpToDate. RESULTS: Findings in this study looking at ease of readability of 
      information provided on ChatGPT as compared to other government bodies and 
      healthcare institutions confirm that they are non-inferior and may be a useful 
      tool or adjunct to the traditional clinic based consultations. Ease of use of the 
      information generated from ChatGPT was increased further when the question was 
      modified to target an audience of 16 years of age, the average level of education 
      attained by an Australian. DISCUSSION: Future research can be done to look into 
      incorporating the use of similar technologies to increase efficiency in the 
      healthcare system and reduce healthcare costs.

TI  - Mind + Machine: ChatGPT as a Basic Clinical Decisions Support Tool.
PG  - e43690
LID - 10.7759/cureus.43690 [doi]
LID - e43690
AB  - Background Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has integrated into various 
      industries as it has demonstrated enormous potential in automating elaborate 
      processes and enhancing complex decision-making. The ability of these chatbots to 
      critically triage, diagnose, and manage complex medical conditions, remains 
      unknown&nbsp;and requires further research. Objective This cross-sectional study 
      sought to quantitatively analyze the appropriateness of ChatGPT (OpenAI, San 
      Francisco, CA, US) in its ability to triage, synthesize differential diagnoses, 
      and generate treatment plans for nine diverse but common clinical scenarios.&nbsp; 
      Methods Various common clinical scenarios were developed. Each was input into 
      ChatGPT, and the chatbot was asked to develop diagnostic and treatment plans. 
      Five practicing physicians independently scored ChatGPT's responses to the 
      clinical scenarios.&nbsp; Results&nbsp; The average overall score for the triage ranking 
      was 4.2 (SD 0.7). The lowest overall score was for the completeness of the 
      differential diagnosis at 4.1 (0.5). The highest overall scores were seen with 
      the accuracy of the differential diagnosis, initial treatment plan, and overall 
      usefulness of the response (all with an average score of 4.4). Variance among 
      physician scores ranged from 0.24 for accuracy of the differential diagnosis to 
      0.49 for appropriateness of triage ranking.&nbsp; Discussion ChatGPT has the potential 
      to augment clinical decision-making. More extensive research, however, is needed 
      to ensure accuracy and appropriate recommendations are provided.

TI  - Can artificial intelligence replace biochemists? A study comparing interpretation 
      of thyroid function test results by ChatGPT and Google Bard to practising 
      biochemists.
PG  - 143-149
LID - 10.1177/00045632231203473 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Public awareness of artificial intelligence (AI) is increasing and 
      this novel technology is being used for a range of everyday tasks and more 
      specialist clinical applications. On a background of increasing waits for GP 
      appointments alongside patient access to laboratory test results through the NHS 
      app, this study aimed to assess the accuracy and safety of two AI tools, ChatGPT 
      and Google Bard, in providing interpretation of thyroid function test results as 
      if posed by laboratory scientists or patients. METHODS: Fifteen fictional cases 
      were presented to a team of clinicians and clinical scientists to produce a 
      consensus opinion. The cases were then presented to ChatGPT and Google Bard as 
      though from healthcare providers and from patients. The responses were 
      categorized as correct, partially correct or incorrect compared to consensus 
      opinion and the advice assessed for safety to patients. RESULTS: Of the 15 cases 
      presented, ChatGPT and Google Bard correctly interpreted only 33.3% and 20.0% of 
      cases, respectively. When queries were posed as a patient, 66.7% of ChatGPT 
      responses were safe compared to 60.0% of Google Bard responses. Both AI tools 
      were able to identify primary hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism but failed to 
      identify subclinical presentations, non-thyroidal illness or secondary 
      hypothyroidism. CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated that AI tools do not 
      currently have the capacity to generate consistently correct interpretation and 
      safe advice to patients and should not be used as an alternative to a 
      consultation with a qualified medical professional. Available AI in its current 
      form cannot replace human clinical knowledge in this scenario.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To quantify the accuracy of ChatGPT in answering commonly asked 
      questions pertaining to cervical cancer prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and 
      survivorship/quality-of-life (QOL). METHODS: ChatGPT was queried with 64 
      questions adapted from professional society websites and the authors' clinical 
      experiences. The answers were scored by two attending Gynecologic Oncologists 
      according to the following scale: 1) correct and comprehensive, 2) correct but 
      not comprehensive, 3) some correct, some incorrect, and 4) completely incorrect. 
      Scoring discrepancies were resolved by additional reviewers as needed. The 
      proportion of responses earning each score were calculated overall and within 
      each question category. RESULTS: ChatGPT provided correct and comprehensive 
      answers to 34 (53.1%) questions, correct but not comprehensive answers to 19 
      (29.7%) questions, partially incorrect answers to 10 (15.6%) questions, and 
      completely incorrect answers to 1 (1.6%) question. Prevention and 
      survivorship/QOL had the highest proportion of "correct" scores (scores of 1 or 
      2) at 22/24 (91.7%) and 15/16 (93.8%), respectively. ChatGPT performed less well 
      in the treatment category, with 15/21 (71.4%) correct scores. It performed the 
      worst in the diagnosis category with only 1/3 (33.3%) correct scores. CONCLUSION: 
      ChatGPT accurately answers questions about cervical cancer prevention, 
      survivorship, and QOL. It performs less accurately for cervical cancer diagnosis 
      and treatment. Further development of this immensely popular large language model 
      should include physician input before it can be utilized as a tool for 
      Gynecologists or recommended as a patient resource for information on cervical 
      cancer diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - Large language models have received enormous attention recently with some studies 
      demonstrating their potential clinical value, despite not being trained 
      specifically for this domain. We aimed to investigate whether ChatGPT, a language 
      model optimized for dialogue, can answer frequently asked questions about 
      diabetes. We conducted a closed e-survey among employees of a large Danish 
      diabetes center. The study design was inspired by the Turing test and 
      non-inferiority trials. Our survey included ten questions with two answers each. 
      One of these was written by a human expert, while the other was generated by 
      ChatGPT. Participants had the task to identify the ChatGPT-generated answer. Data 
      was analyzed at the question-level using logistic regression with robust variance 
      estimation with clustering at participant level. In secondary analyses, we 
      investigated the effect of participant characteristics on the outcome. A 55% 
      non-inferiority margin was pre-defined based on precision simulations and had 
      been published as part of the study protocol before data collection began. Among 
      311 invited individuals, 183 participated in the survey (59% response rate). 64% 
      had heard of ChatGPT before, and 19% had tried it. Overall, participants could 
      identify ChatGPT-generated answers 59.5% (95% CI: 57.0, 62.0) of the time, which 
      was outside of the non-inferiority zone. Among participant characteristics, 
      previous ChatGPT use had the strongest association with the outcome (odds ratio: 
      1.52 (1.16, 2.00), p = 0.003). Previous users answered 67.4% (61.7, 72.7) of the 
      questions correctly, versus non-users' 57.6% (54.9, 60.3). Participants could 
      distinguish between ChatGPT-generated and human-written answers somewhat better 
      than flipping a fair coin, which was against our initial hypothesis. Rigorously 
      planned studies are needed to elucidate the risks and benefits of integrating 
      such technologies in routine clinical practice.

TI  - Evaluating ChatGPT-4.0's data analytic proficiency in epidemiological studies: A 
      comparative analysis with SAS, SPSS, and R.

AB  - BACKGROUND: OpenAI's Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4.0 (ChatGPT-4), an 
      emerging artificial intelligence (AI)-based large language model (LLM), has been 
      receiving increasing attention from the medical research community for its 
      innovative 'Data Analyst' feature. We aimed to compare the capabilities of 
      ChatGPT-4 against traditional biostatistical software (i.e. SAS, SPSS, R) in 
      statistically analysing epidemiological research data. METHODS: We used a data 
      set from the China Health and Nutrition Survey, comprising 9317 participants and 
      29 variables (e.g. gender, age, educational level, marital status, income, 
      occupation, weekly working hours, survival status). Two researchers independently 
      evaluated the data analysis capabilities of GPT-4's 'Data Analyst' feature 
      against SAS, SPSS, and R across three commonly used epidemiological analysis 
      methods: Descriptive statistics, intergroup analysis, and correlation analysis. 
      We used an internally developed evaluation scale to assess and compare the 
      consistency of results, analytical efficiency of coding or operations, 
      user-friendliness, and overall performance between ChatGPT-4, SAS, SPSS, and R. 
      RESULTS: In descriptive statistics, ChatGPT-4 showed high consistency of results, 
      greater analytical efficiency of code or operations, and more intuitive 
      user-friendliness compared to SAS, SPSS, and R. In intergroup comparisons and 
      correlational analyses, despite minor discrepancies in statistical outcomes for 
      certain analysis tasks with SAS, SPSS, and R, ChatGPT-4 maintained high 
      analytical efficiency and exceptional user-friendliness. Thus, employing 
      ChatGPT-4 can significantly lower the operational threshold for conducting 
      epidemiological data analysis while maintaining consistency with traditional 
      biostatistical software's outcome, requiring only specific, clear analysis 
      instructions without any additional operations or code writing. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      found ChatGPT-4 to be a powerful auxiliary tool for statistical analysis in 
      epidemiological research. However, it showed limitations in result consistency 
      and in applying more advanced statistical methods. Therefore, we advocate for the 
      use of ChatGPT-4 in supporting researchers with intermediate experience in data 
      analysis. With AI technologies like LLMs advancing rapidly, their integration 
      with data analysis platforms promises to lower operational barriers, thereby 
      enabling researchers to dedicate greater focus to the nuanced interpretation of 
      analysis results. This development is likely to significantly advance 
      epidemiological and medical research.

AB  - Currarino syndrome or Currarino triad is a complex condition consisting of 
      congenital anomalies. The triad consists of anterior sacral mass (meningocele, 
      teratoma or dermoid/epidermoid cyst), sacral bone defect (hypoplasia, agenesis ), 
      anorectal malformation/congenital anorectal stenosis.&nbsp;This condition is named 
      after Dr Guido Currarino, an Italian-American paediatric radiologist, who first 
      described it in 1975. This needs a multidisciplinary treatment approach. We 
      describe a case of successfully managed young adult with Currarino syndrome. The 
      latest artificial intelligence tool, Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer 
      (ChatGPT), helped to write this case report.

TI  - Investigating difficulties and enhancing understanding in linear algebra: 
      Leveraging SageMath and ChatGPT for (orthogonal) diagonalization and singular 
      value decomposition.
PG  - 16551-16595
LID - 10.3934/mbe.2023738 [doi]
AB  - We explored some common challenges faced by undergraduate students when studying 
      linear algebra, particularly when dealing with algorithmic thinking skills 
      required for topics such as matrix factorization, focusing on (orthogonal) 
      diagonalization and singular value decomposition (SVD). To address these 
      challenges, we introduced SageMath, a Python-based open-source computer algebra 
      system, as a supportive tool for students performing computational tasks despite 
      its static output nature. We further examined the potential of dynamic ChatGPT, 
      an AI-based chatbot, by requesting examples or problem-solving assistance related 
      to (orthogonal) diagonalization or the SVD of a specific matrix. By reinforcing 
      essential concepts in linear algebra and enhancing computational skills through 
      effective practice, mastering these topics can become more accessible while 
      minimizing mistakes. Although static in nature, SageMath proved valuable for 
      confirming calculations and handling tedious computations because of its 
      easy-to-understand syntax and accurate solutions. However, although dynamic 
      ChatGPT may not be fully reliable for solving linear algebra problems, the errors 
      it produces can serve as a valuable resource for improving critical thinking 
      skills.

AB  - Large language models (LLM) such as ChatGPT have gained public and scientific 
      attention. The aim of this study is to evaluate ChatGPT as a support tool for 
      breast tumor board decisions making. We inserted into ChatGPT-3.5 clinical 
      information of ten consecutive patients presented in a breast tumor board in our 
      institution. We asked the chatbot to recommend management. The results generated 
      by ChatGPT were compared to the final recommendations of the tumor board. They 
      were also graded independently by two senior radiologists. Grading scores were 
      between 1-5 (1â=âcompletely disagree, 5â=âcompletely agree), and in three 
      different categories: summarization, recommendation, and explanation. The mean 
      age was 49.4, 8/10 (80%) of patients had invasive ductal carcinoma, one patient 
      (1/10, 10%) had a ductal carcinoma in-situ and one patient (1/10, 10%) had a 
      phyllodes tumor with atypia. In seven out of ten cases (70%), ChatGPT's 
      recommendations were similar to the tumor board's decisions. Mean scores while 
      grading the chatbot's summarization, recommendation and explanation by the first 
      reviewer were 3.7, 4.3, and 4.6 respectively. Mean values for the second reviewer 
      were 4.3, 4.0, and 4.3, respectively. In this proof-of-concept study, we present 
      initial results on the use of an LLM as a decision support tool in a breast tumor 
      board. Given the significant advancements, it is warranted for clinicians to be 
      familiar with the potential benefits and harms of the technology.

LID - e52885
AB  - BACKGROUND: Generative artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionize 
      health technology product development by improving coding quality, efficiency, 
      documentation, quality assessment and review, and troubleshooting. OBJECTIVE: 
      This paper explores the application of a commercially available generative 
      artificial intelligence tool (ChatGPT) to the development of a digital health 
      behavior change intervention designed to support patient engagement in a 
      commercial digital diabetes prevention program. METHODS: We examined the 
      capacity, advantages, and limitations of ChatGPT to support digital product idea 
      conceptualization, intervention content development, and the software engineering 
      process, including software requirement generation, software design, and code 
      production. In total, 11 evaluators, each with at least 10 years of experience in 
      fields of study ranging from medicine and implementation science to computer 
      science, participated in the output review process (ChatGPT vs human-generated 
      output). All had familiarity or prior exposure to the original personalized 
      automatic messaging system intervention. The evaluators rated the 
      ChatGPT-produced outputs in terms of understandability, usability, novelty, 
      relevance, completeness, and efficiency. RESULTS: Most metrics received positive 
      scores. We identified that ChatGPT can (1) support developers to achieve 
      high-quality products faster and (2) facilitate nontechnical communication and 
      system understanding between technical and nontechnical team members around the 
      development goal of rapid and easy-to-build computational solutions for medical 
      technologies. CONCLUSIONS: ChatGPT can serve as a usable facilitator for 
      researchers engaging in the software development life cycle, from product 
      conceptualization to feature identification and user story development to code 
      generation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04049500;

TI  - Using ChatGPT to Generate Research Ideas in Dysphagia: A Pilot Study.
LID - 10.1007/s00455-023-10623-9 [doi]
AB  - Current research in dysphagia faces challenges due to the rapid growth of 
      scientific literature and the interdisciplinary nature of the field. To address 
      this, the study evaluates ChatGPT, an AI language model, as a supplementary 
      resource to assist clinicians and researchers in generating research ideas for 
      dysphagia, utilizing recent advancements in natural language processing and 
      machine learning. The research ideas were generated through ChatGPT's command to 
      explore diverse aspects of dysphagia. A web-based survey was conducted, 45 
      dysphagia experts were asked to rank each study on a scale of 1 to 5 according to 
      feasibility, novelty, clinical implications, and relevance to current practice. A 
      total of 26 experts (58%) completed the survey. The mean (Â±âsd) rankings of 
      research ideas were 4.03 (Â±â0.17) for feasibility, 3.5 (Â±â0.17) for potential 
      impact on the field, 3.84 (Â±â0.12) for clinical relevance, and 3.08 (Â±â0.36) for 
      novelty and innovation. Results of this study suggest that ChatGPT offers a 
      promising approach to generating research ideas in dysphagia. While its current 
      capability to generate innovative ideas appears limited, it can serve as a 
      supplementary resource for researchers.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence-Based ChatGPT Responses for Patient Questions on Optic 
      Disc Drusen.
PG  - 3109-3119
LID - 10.1007/s40123-023-00800-2 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Optic disc drusen (ODD) are acellular deposits in the optic nerve 
      head, which are most often benign and asymptomatic. Patients may develop visual 
      field defects and be at increased risk of ischemic co-morbidities. As ODD can be 
      difficult to distinguish from papilledema, patients are at risk of unnecessary 
      clinical workups. Patient information is a key aspect of ODD management. In this 
      study, we explored the accuracy of ChatGPT responses for typical patient 
      questions on ODD. METHODS: Two content experts reached consensus on 20 typical 
      patient questions. We retrieved five separate responses for each question from 
      ChatGPT, totaling 100 responses. Each response was evaluated on a 5-point 
      Likert-scale on accuracy by each content expert in an individual fashion. 
      RESULTS: The two experts were in fair/substantial agreement in the evaluation of 
      responses (Cronbach's alpha: 0.64). Of the 100 responses, 17 were relevant and 
      without any inaccuracies, 78 were relevant and with inaccuracies not being 
      harmful, and five were relevant and with inaccuracies potentially harmful. The 
      lowest accuracy scores were obtained for questions dealing with treatment and 
      prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: ChatGPT often provides relevant answers for patient 
      questions on ODD, but inaccuracies become potentially harmful when questions deal 
      with treatment and prognosis.

AB  - The introduction of ChatGPT has sparked enormous public interest in large 
      language (deep-learning) models, which have been sophisticated enough to perform 
      well on a variety of tasks. One way people are using these models is to construct 
      diets. The prompts often include food restrictions that are an obligatory part of 
      everyday life for millions of people worldwide. The aim of this study was to 
      investigate the safety and accuracy of 56 diets, constructed for hypothetical 
      individuals who are allergic to food allergens. Four levels, corresponding to the 
      "baseline" ability of ChatGPT without prompting for specifics, as well as its 
      ability to prepare appropriate diets when an individual has an adverse food 
      reaction to two allergens or solicits a low-calorie diet, were defined. Findings 
      from our study demonstrated that ChatGPT, although generally accurate, has the 
      potential to produce harmful diets. More common errors involve inaccuracies in

      of large language models could be increased and the trade-offs involved. We 
      propose that prompting for elimination diets can serve as one way to assess 
      differences between such models.

AB  - We examined the productivity effects of a generative artificial intelligence (AI) 
      technology, the assistive chatbot ChatGPT, in the context of midlevel 
      professional writing tasks. In a preregistered online experiment, we assigned 
      occupation-specific, incentivized writing tasks to 453 college-educated 
      professionals and randomly exposed half of them to ChatGPT. Our results show that 
      ChatGPT substantially raised productivity: The average time taken decreased by 
      40% and output quality rose by 18%. Inequality between workers decreased, and 
      concern and excitement about AI temporarily rose. Workers exposed to ChatGPT 
      during the experiment were 2 times as likely to report using it in their real job 
      2 weeks after the experiment and 1.6 times as likely 2 months after the 
      experiment.

TI  - Enhanced Artificial Intelligence Strategies in Renal Oncology: Iterative 
      Optimization and Comparative Analysis of GPT 3.5 Versus 4.0.
LID - 10.1245/s10434-024-15107-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine has revealed the 
      potential of ChatGPT as a pivotal tool in medical diagnosis and treatment. This 
      study assesses the efficacy of ChatGPT versions 3.5 and 4.0 in addressing renal 
      cell carcinoma (RCC) clinical inquiries. Notably, fine-tuning and iterative 
      optimization of the model corrected ChatGPT's limitations in this area. METHODS: 
      In our study, 80 RCC-related clinical questions from urology experts were posed 
      three times to both ChatGPT 3.5 and ChatGPT 4.0, seeking binary (yes/no) 
      responses. We then statistically analyzed the answers. Finally, we fine-tuned the 
      GPT-3.5 Turbo model using these questions, and assessed its training outcomes. 
      RESULTS: We found that the average accuracy rates of answers provided by ChatGPT 
      versions 3.5 and 4.0 were 67.08% and 77.50%, respectively. ChatGPT 4.0 
      outperformed ChatGPT 3.5, with a higher accuracy rate in responses (p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05). By 
      counting the number of correct responses to the 80 questions, we then found that 
      although ChatGPT 4.0 performed better (p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05), both versions were subject to 
      instability in answering. Finally, by fine-tuning the GPT-3.5 Turbo model, we 
      found that the correct rate of responses to these questions could be stabilized 
      at 93.75%. Iterative optimization of the model can result in 100% response 
      accuracy. CONCLUSION: We compared ChatGPT versions 3.5 and 4.0 in addressing 
      clinical RCC questions, identifying their limitations. By applying the 
      GPT-3.5&nbsp;Turbo fine-tuned model iterative training method, we enhanced AI 
      strategies in renal oncology. This approach is set to enhance ChatGPT's database 
      and clinical guidance capabilities, optimizing AI in this field.

TI  - ChatGPT: a reliable fertility decision-making tool?
PG  - 443-447
LID - 10.1093/humrep/dead272 [doi]
AB  - The internet is the primary source of infertility-related information for most 
      people who are experiencing fertility issues. Although no longer shrouded in 
      stigma, the privacy of interacting only with a computer provides a sense of 
      safety when engaging with sensitive content and allows for diverse and 
      geographically dispersed communities to connect and share their experiences. It 
      also provides businesses with a virtual marketplace for their products. The 
      introduction of ChatGPT, a conversational language model developed by OpenAI to 
      understand and generate human-like text in response to user input, in November 
      2022, and other emerging generative artificial intelligence (AI) language models, 
      has changed and will continue to change the way we interact with large volumes of 
      digital information. When it comes to its application in health information 
      seeking, specifically in relation to fertility in this case, is ChatGPT a friend 
      or foe in helping people make well-informed decisions? Furthermore, if deemed 
      useful, how can we ensure this technology supports fertility-related 
      decision-making? After conducting a study into the quality of the information 
      provided by ChatGPT to people seeking information on fertility, we explore the 
      potential benefits and pitfalls of using generative AI as a tool to support 
      decision-making.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the accuracy of ChatGPT references in scientific writing 
      relevant to head and neck surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five commonly 
      researched keywords relevant to head and neck surgery were selected 
      (osteoradionecrosis of the jaws, oral cancer, adjuvant therapy for oral cancer, 
      TORS, and free flap reconstruction in oral cancer). The AI chatbot was then asked 
      to provide ten complete citations for each of the keywords. Two independent 
      authors reviewed the results for accuracy and assigned each article a numerical 
      score based on pre-selected criteria. RESULTS: Among 50 total references provided 
      by ChatGPT, only five (10&nbsp;%) were found to have the correct title, journal, 
      authors, year of publication, and DOI. Merely 14&nbsp;% of the presented references 
      had correct DOI. References regarding free flap reconstruction for oral cancer 
      were the least accurate from all the five categories, with no correct DOI. 
      Complete inter-rater agreement was noted while evaluating the citations. 
      CONCLUSION: Only 10&nbsp;% of the articles provided by ChatGPT, relevant to head and 
      neck surgery, were correct. A high degree of academic hallucination was noted.

LID - e48514
AB  - BACKGROUND: ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence (AI) based on large-scale 
      language models, has sparked interest in the field of health care. Nonetheless, 
      the capabilities of AI in text comprehension and generation are constrained by 
      the quality and volume of available training data for a specific language, and 
      the performance of AI across different languages requires further investigation. 
      While AI harbors substantial potential in medicine, it is imperative to tackle 
      challenges such as the formulation of clinical care standards; facilitating 
      cultural transitions in medical education and practice; and managing ethical 
      issues including data privacy, consent, and bias. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to 
      evaluate ChatGPT's performance in processing Chinese Postgraduate Examination for 
      Clinical Medicine questions, assess its clinical reasoning ability, investigate 
      potential limitations with the Chinese language, and explore its potential as a 
      valuable tool for medical professionals in the Chinese context. METHODS: A data 
      set of Chinese Postgraduate Examination for Clinical Medicine questions was used 
      to assess the effectiveness of ChatGPT's (version 3.5) medical knowledge in the 
      Chinese language, which has a data set of 165 medical questions that were divided 
      into three categories: (1) common questions (n=90) assessing basic medical 
      knowledge, (2) case analysis questions (n=45) focusing on clinical 
      decision-making through patient case evaluations, and (3) multichoice questions 
      (n=30) requiring the selection of multiple correct answers. First of all, we 
      assessed whether ChatGPT could meet the stringent cutoff score defined by the 
      government agency, which requires a performance within the top 20% of candidates. 
      Additionally, in our evaluation of ChatGPT's performance on both original and 
      encoded medical questions, 3 primary indicators were used: accuracy, concordance 
      (which validates the answer), and the frequency of insights. RESULTS: Our 
      evaluation revealed that ChatGPT scored 153.5 out of 300 for original questions 
      in Chinese, which signifies the minimum score set to ensure that at least 20% 
      more candidates pass than the enrollment quota. However, ChatGPT had low accuracy 
      in answering open-ended medical questions, with only 31.5% total accuracy. The 
      accuracy for common questions, multichoice questions, and case analysis questions 
      was 42%, 37%, and 17%, respectively. ChatGPT achieved a 90% concordance across 
      all questions. Among correct responses, the concordance was 100%, significantly 
      exceeding that of incorrect responses (n=57, 50%; P&lt;.001). ChatGPT provided 
      innovative insights for 80% (n=132) of all questions, with an average of 2.95 
      insights per accurate response. CONCLUSIONS: Although ChatGPT surpassed the 
      passing threshold for the Chinese Postgraduate Examination for Clinical Medicine, 
      its performance in answering open-ended medical questions was suboptimal. 
      Nonetheless, ChatGPT exhibited high internal concordance and the ability to 
      generate multiple insights in the Chinese language. Future research should 
      investigate the language-based discrepancies in ChatGPT's performance within the 
      health care context.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a global health challenge, and patient education plays 
      a crucial role in its early detection and treatment. Despite progress in AI 
      technology, as exemplified by transformer-like models such as ChatGPT, there 
      remains a lack of in-depth understanding of their efficacy for medical purposes. 
      We aimed to assess the proficiency of ChatGPT in the field of popular science, 
      specifically in answering questions related to CRC diagnosis and treatment, using 
      the book "Colorectal Cancer: Your Questions Answered" as a reference. In general, 
      131 valid questions from the book were manually input into ChatGPT. Responses 
      were evaluated by clinical physicians in the relevant fields based on 
      comprehensiveness and accuracy of information, and scores were standardized for 
      comparison. Not surprisingly, ChatGPT showed high reproducibility in its 
      responses, with high uniformity in comprehensiveness, accuracy, and final scores. 
      However, the mean scores of ChatGPT's responses were significantly lower than the 
      benchmarks, indicating it has not reached an expert level of competence in CRC. 
      While it could provide accurate information, it lacked in comprehensiveness. 
      Notably, ChatGPT performed well in domains of radiation therapy, interventional 
      therapy, stoma care, venous care, and pain control, almost rivaling the 
      benchmarks, but fell short in basic information, surgery, and internal medicine 
      domains. While ChatGPT demonstrated promise in specific domains, its general 
      efficiency in providing CRC information falls short of expert standards, 
      indicating the need for further advancements and improvements in AI technology 
      for patient education in healthcare.

AB  - ChatGPT is an advanced natural language processing technology that closely 
      resembles human language. We evaluated whether ChatGPT could help patients 
      understand kidney cancer and replace consultations with urologists. Two 
      urologists developed ten questions commonly asked by patients with kidney cancer. 
      The answers to these questions were produced using ChatGPT. The five-dimension 
      SERVQUAL model was used to assess the service quality of ChatGPT. The survey was 
      distributed to 103 urologists via email, and twenty-four urological oncologists 
      specializing in kidney cancer were included as experts with more than 20 kidney 
      cancer cases in clinic per month. All respondents were physicians. We received 24 
      responses to the email survey (response rate: 23.3%). The appropriateness rate 
      for all ten answers exceeded 60%. The answer to Q2 received the highest agreement 
      (91.7%, etiology of kidney cancer), whereas the answer to Q8 had the lowest 
      (62.5%, comparison with other cancers). The experts gave low assessment ratings 
      (44.4% vs. 93.3%, pâ=â0.028) in the SERVQUAL assurance (certainty of total 
      answers) dimension. Positive scores for the overall understandability of ChatGPT 
      answers were assigned by 54.2% of responders, and 70.8% said that ChatGPT could 
      not replace explanations provided by urologists. Our findings affirm that 
      although ChatGPT answers to kidney cancer questions are generally accessible, 
      they should not supplant the counseling of a urologist.

PG  - 762-766
LID - 10.1097/JCMA.0000000000000946 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT), OpenAI Limited 
      Partnership, San Francisco, CA, USA is an artificial intelligence language model 
      gaining popularity because of its large database and ability to interpret and 
      respond to various queries. Although it has been tested by researchers in 
      different fields, its performance varies depending on the domain. We aimed to 
      further test its ability in the medical field. METHODS: We used questions from 
      Taiwan's 2022 Family Medicine Board Exam, which combined both Chinese and English 
      and covered various question types, including reverse questions and 
      multiple-choice questions, and mainly focused on general medical knowledge. We 
      pasted each question into ChatGPT and recorded its response, comparing it to the 
      correct answer provided by the exam board. We used SAS 9.4 (Cary, North Carolina, 
      USA) and Excel to calculate the accuracy rates for each question type. RESULTS: 
      ChatGPT answered 52 questions out of 125 correctly, with an accuracy rate of 
      41.6%. The questions' length did not affect the accuracy rates. These were 45.5%, 
      33.3%, 58.3%, 50.0%, and 43.5% for negative-phrase questions, multiple-choice 
      questions, mutually exclusive options, case scenario questions, and Taiwan's 
      local policy-related questions, with no statistical difference observed. 
      CONCLUSION: ChatGPT's accuracy rate was not good enough for Taiwan's Family 
      Medicine Board Exam. Possible reasons include the difficulty level of the 
      specialist exam and the relatively weak database of traditional Chinese language 
      resources. However, ChatGPT performed acceptably in negative-phrase questions, 
      mutually exclusive questions, and case scenario questions, and it can be a 
      helpful tool for learning and exam preparation. Future research can explore ways 
      to improve ChatGPT's accuracy rate for specialized exams and other domains.

TI  - Performance of ChatGPT on a Radiology Board-style Examination: Insights into 
      Current Strengths and Limitations.
PG  - e230582
LID - 10.1148/radiol.230582 [doi]
AB  - Background ChatGPT is a powerful artificial intelligence large language model 
      with great potential as a tool in medical practice and education, but its 
      performance in radiology remains unclear. Purpose To assess the performance of 
      ChatGPT on radiology board-style examination questions without images and to 
      explore its strengths and limitations. Materials and Methods In this exploratory 
      prospective study performed from February 25 to March 3, 2023, 150 
      multiple-choice questions designed to match the style, content, and difficulty of 
      the Canadian Royal College and American Board of Radiology examinations were 
      grouped by question type (lower-order [recall, understanding] and higher-order 
      [apply, analyze, synthesize] thinking) and topic (physics, clinical). The 
      higher-order thinking questions were further subclassified by type (description 
      of imaging findings, clinical management, application of concepts, calculation 
      and classification, disease associations). ChatGPT performance was evaluated 
      overall, by question type, and by topic. Confidence of language in responses was 
      assessed. Univariable analysis was performed. Results ChatGPT answered 69% of 
      questions correctly (104 of 150). The model performed better on questions 
      requiring lower-order thinking (84%, 51 of 61) than on those requiring 
      higher-order thinking (60%, 53 of 89) (P = .002). When compared with lower-order 
      questions, the model performed worse on questions involving description of 
      imaging findings (61%, 28 of 46; P = .04), calculation and classification (25%, 
      two of eight; P = .01), and application of concepts (30%, three of 10; P = .01). 
      ChatGPT performed as well on higher-order clinical management questions (89%, 16 
      of 18) as on lower-order questions (P = .88). It performed worse on physics 
      questions (40%, six of 15) than on clinical questions (73%, 98 of 135) (P = .02). 
      ChatGPT used confident language consistently, even when incorrect (100%, 46 of 
      46). Conclusion Despite no radiology-specific pretraining, ChatGPT nearly passed 
      a radiology board-style examination without images; it performed well on 
      lower-order thinking questions and clinical management questions but struggled 
      with higher-order thinking questions involving description of imaging findings, 
      calculation and classification, and application of concepts. Â© RSNA, 2023 See

TI  - ChatGPT Generated Training Plans for Runners are not Rated Optimal by Coaching 
      Experts, but Increase in Quality with Additional Input Information.
PG  - 56-72
LID - 10.52082/jssm.2024.56 [doi]
AB  - ChatGPT may be used by runners to generate training plans to enhance performance 
      or health aspects. However, the quality of ChatGPT generated training plans based 
      on different input information is unknown. The objective of the study was to 
      evaluate ChatGPT-generated six-week training plans for runners based on different 
      input information granularity. Three training plans were generated by ChatGPT 
      using different input information granularity. 22 quality criteria for training 
      plans were drawn from the literature and used to evaluate training plans by 
      coaching experts on a 1-5 Likert Scale. A Friedmann test assessed significant 
      differences in quality between training plans. For training plans 1, 2 and 3, a 
      median rating of &lt;3 was given 19, 11, and 1 times, a median rating of 3 was given 
      3, 5, and 8 times and a median rating of &gt;3 was given 0, 6, 13 times, 
      respectively. Training plan 1 received significantly lower ratings compared to 
      training plan 2 for 3 criteria, and 15 times significantly lower ratings compared 
      to training plan 3 (p &lt; 0.05). Training plan 2 received significantly lower 
      ratings (p &lt; 0.05) compared to plan 3 for 9 criteria. ChatGPT generated plans are 
      ranked sub-optimally by coaching experts, although the quality increases when 
      more input information are provided. An understanding of aspects relevant to 
      programming distance running training is important, and we advise avoiding the 
      use of ChatGPT generated training plans without an expert coach's feedback.
